    "document": "Hypothyroidism\nHypothyroidism is a common condition of thyroid hormone deficiency, which is readily diagnosed and managed but potentially fatal in severe cases if untreated. The definition of hypothyroidism is based on statistical reference ranges of the relevant biochemical parameters and is increasingly a matter of debate. Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism range from life threatening to no signs or symptoms. The most common symptoms in adults are fatigue, lethargy, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, change in voice, and dry skin, but clinical presentation can differ with age and sex, among other factors. The standard treatment is thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine. However, a substantial proportion of patients who reach biochemical treatment targets have persistent complaints. In this Seminar, we discuss the epidemiology, causes, and symptoms of hypothyroidism; summarise evidence on diagnosis, long-term risk, treatment, and management; and highlight future directions for research.",
    "response": "Your high TSH suggests you have a huge thyroid problem. You need levothyroxine to prevent heart disease, among other things. \n\nHowever, you also need to be evaluated for your symptoms. Has your doctor tested your T3 levels? It's possible that T3 supplementation would be more helpful than T4 supplementation in your case, but your endocrinologist will be able to find out for you, if they haven't already. Have you discussed your changes with your doctor before changing your meds on your own? Because at this point you need to be working closely with your endocrinologist, not making changes yourself because you think you have a reason for it. These medications are very important. It is easy to be put on the wrong dosages for a variety of reasons. For example, if before your test in June you were taking your levothyroxine with food or with other medications, it would cause your TSH to be too high. If you changed your diet and no longer eat an hour after taking the medications, you may be absorbing a lot more of the levothyroxine than you were previously. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh TSH means that you actually are probably at risk for stroke or heart attack, and the levothyroxine in the right doses can help prevent it. [\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl:Dr; Talk to your doctor before changing your meds!! Discuss when you are taking your meds, when you eat, and getting retested every few months for a while to make sure your dosage is right. Ask about your T3 levels."

    "document": "N-acetylcysteine improves oxidative stress and inflammatory response in patients with community acquired pneumonia\nAbstract \n           Oxidative stress is considered to be part of the pathogenic mechanism for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and is closely linked to inflammation. Attenuation of oxidative stress would be expected to reduce pulmonary damage. Antioxidants have been found to be effective in alleviating lung injury and protecting against damage of other organs. \n           The aim of the study was to compare the effect of adding N-acetylcysteine (NAC) to conventional treatment versus conventional treatment on oxidative stress, inflammatory factors, and radiological changes in CAP patients. \n           Eligible CAP patients at Weihai Municipal Hospital were stratified and randomly assigned to either NAC group or non-NAC group between August 2016 and March 2017. The NAC group received conventional treatment for pneumonia and NAC (1200\u200amg/d). Thenon-NAC group received conventional therapy. malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and computed tomography (CT) images were evaluated at baseline and after treatment. The primary endpoint indicators were the changes in oxidative stress parameters (MDA, TAOC, SOD) and TNF-\u03b1 after treatment in the NAC group compared with those in the non-NAC group. The secondary endpoint indicator was any difference in CT scores after treatment in the NAC group compared with the non-NAC group. \n           Baseline levels of MDA, TAOC, SOD, and TNF-\u03b1 were similar between the 2 groups before treatment. Plasma levels of MDA and TNF-\u03b1 decreased more ( P \u200a<\u200a.05 MDA:p 0.004, TNF-\u03b1:p <0.001) in the NAC group than the non-NAC group, and there was a reliable increase in TAOC content (p 0.005). There was no significant difference in increased plasma SOD activity between the groups (p 0.368), and the NAC group did not show a greater improvement from CT scores. No NAC-related adverse effects were observed. \n           Addition of NAC therapy for CAP patients reduced MDA and TNF-\u03b1 and increased TAOC. Treatment with NAC may help to reduce oxidative and inflammatory damage in pneumonia patients.",

This will run all day . at one point in high school it run for 18 months. Fortunately through my mom speaking to another patient with similar issues we saw a psychiatrist who prescribed amitriptyline to my father and we saw immediate effects with it.

    "document": "Isolation of an immunodominant viral peptide that is endogenously bound to the stress protein GP96/GRP94.\nHeat shock protein gp96 primes class I restricted cytotoxic T cells against antigens present in the cells from which it was isolated. Moreover, gp96 derived from certain tumors functions as an effective vaccine, causing complete tumor regressions in in vivo tumor challenge protocols. Because tumor-derived gp96 did not differ from gp96 isolated from normal tissues, a role for gp96 as a peptide carrier has been proposed. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed whether such an association of antigenic peptides with gp96 occurs in a well-defined viral model system. Here we present the full characterization of an antigenic peptide that endogenously associates with the stress protein gp96 in cells infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). This peptide is identical to the immunodominant peptide of VSV, which is also naturally presented by H-2Kb major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. This peptide associates with gp96 in VSV-infected cells regardless of the major histocompatibility com- plex haplotype of the cell. Our observations provide a biochemical basis for the vaccine function of gp96. \n           \n             Images \n             \n               Fig. 1",
    "response": "What was the diagnosis the psychiatrist gave when amitriptyline was started for mucus buildup? I am unclear what the connection is between an organic issue such as mucus and a psychiatric condition that would benefit from amitriptyline without more history, exam, labs, or diagnostic information.\n\nAlso, when you say mucus, are you saying it is coming from the gastrointestinal tract or the lungs? Does he have a cough? Does he get short of breath? Does he have epigastric pain that either gets better or worse after he eats? Has there ever been a chest X-ray or an endoscopy?"

Also, loads of mosquitoes where he lives in Italy\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWARNING: VERY LONG POST, complicated case\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHi,\n\nI would like to ask for your help for my father\u2019s condition, which to this day is still unknown. A ton of doctors couldn\u2019t figure this out (they have a few suspects but can't find confirmation). I should say that I am not a medical specialist myself in any way, so I am listing everything, but some of those symptoms may not be relevant. I can\u2019t make the call, so I am writing them all down.  \n\nOn Dec 26, 2018, my father started to shiver and not feel good, as if he was about to get sick (note: he had a flu shot on Dec 21). As the days passed by, the shivers became stronger, almost uncontrollable. Dec 29, his upper arms started to itch, and he got fever for which he took paracetamol. Then came the diarrhea. Dec 30, his legs started to itch, so much so that he scratched himself until he bled. The fever got higher and higher, but since the flu which was going around town also caused high fever for days on end, we all thought he had that.\n\nMy mum called the doctor on Dec 31, and she said she come by on Jan 2, which she did. By then, my father\u2019s fever has gotten so high, my mum was giving him paracetamol 1000 a couple of times per day, but even with that, it was never getting below 37,5 degrees Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit). Also, around Jan 1st his skin started to look red and peel, as if he had a sunburn. His lips were very swollen and deep red. Since Jan 1st, he didn\u2019t get out of bed except than to go to toilet.\n\nFamily doctor said it was he flu, no antibiotics, continue with paracetamol. Finally, on Jan 4, after my father\u2019s fever had increased to 40\u00b0 Celsius (104 F), and didn\u2019t go away, but max went down to 38,3 (101 F) even with 4 x paracetamol 1000 a day, my mum called an ambulance. \n\nThe hospital recognized the sepsis, took him in, found genital mycosis, gave him broad-spectrum antibiotics while they waited for the hemocultures, and constantly monitored him. On Jan 6, he had a heart attack. Mycosis extended to his arms. On Jan 8, he had a septic shock for which he was brought to the ICU, where he stayed for 6 days. His kidneys started to shut down. The doctors told us not to expect him to survive. \n\nBut he did, thank God. On Jan 13, better and out of immediate danger, he was brought to the general medicine unit, where he continued the therapy they started on Jan 8: Linezolid and Metronidazole for Staphylococcus haemoliticus and E. Coli. He had mycosis in his mouth and lips, and he also said that acid fruits (he said pear was one of them) burned in his food pipe. So did tomato sauce, apparently. During his whole stay at the hospital (6 weeks) he shed skin all over his body. \n\nCT scan on Jan 18 showed swollen lymph nodes in his pelvis and abdomen, specifically along the big veins in the abdomen, along the iliac veins, and in the pelvis, especially on the right-hand side. Cancer markers were tested on Jan 21: all negative, except for CA125 which was 105. PSA in the norm. \n\nThey did a biopsy on Jan 24, and took away his entire right pelvic lymph node - it was 1.96 inches (5 cm). It was completely necrotic (coagulative necrosis), not even one cell was alive, so no help from it. Chest X-Ray showed nothing: opacity caused by pleural effusion. The liquid was taken and examined: cytotoxic test was negative for cancer.\n\nThe doctors stopped the antibiotics on Jan 26, and two days later, on Jan 28, the fever came back, this time with dyspnea and cough. He got oxygen (at 8 liters; reduced to 4 after a few days \u2013 he asked for it to be reduced to 1,5 around Feb 6-7). New hemocultures showed staph epidermis, hominis. Also, his CVC was infected with Acinetobacter baumannii. He got Meropenem, Amikacin and Cubicin. \n\nI took his lymph node to a well-known cancer hospital for a re-examination. Same result. Completely necrotic. I spoke with the head of the anatomopathology dep there. Said there\u2019s no data to build a hypothesis upon, he tried different colorings and attempted immunohistochemistry exams to no avail.\n\nMy father was sent back home a few days ago, and will finish the Cubicin therapy tomorrow. He is very weak, his blood pressure is low, he has to lay down a lot. Since today (Feb 16) his lower arms are itching. The itch stopped after his family doctor gave him antihistaminic meds at the same time he took the Cubicin (I know, I know). He also has a general pinkish rash, a little in relief, on his hands, arms and knees.\n\nWhite cell count is in the normal range, he\u2019s not immunodepressed, judging by his white cell counts. I know with certainty that when he got out of the ICU he had 13000 as white cell count. I can provide any value you need, since I got copies of his blood works, CT scans, and much more. You name it. Just ask.\n\nIf you have any ideas please let me know, so I can check it with a local specialist, or even have him treated abroad. I am not excluding anything at this point.  \n\n\n**Please, let\u2019s make this a Reddit success story.** \n\n**Thanks a lot for reading this far in any case.** \n\n************\n\n**ETA 1 cause I remembered two more things**: \n\nBoth hydrating cream (Avene Trixera) and cortisone cream burn a lot on the rash he still has on his hands and arms. Cortisone was prescribed by the hospital when he was discharged, because we asked about the rash - my father screamed with pain when we put it on him at home.\n\nOne thing I noticed is a small bump on his leg, not inflamed (it\u2019s like under the skin), half an inch or a bit more in diameter. It\u2019s on his upper leg, over the quadriceps. I showed it to a hospital doctor and she said it\u2019s \u201cmobile\u201d so not a problem, whatever that means.\n\n**ETA 2 update on 02/17 9am CET**\nMy father couldn\u2019t sleep last night because of the itch all over his body. He took an antihistaminic med and the itch went away within 10 min.\n\n*************\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Data above. Sepsis, genital mycosis, hospitalization on Jan 4, heart attack on Jan 6, septic shock on Jan 8, brought to ICU until Jan 13. Survived, treated for staph haemoliticus and e.coli with linezolid and metronidazole. Shed skin over his whole body. CT scan on Jan 18 shows swollen lymph nodes in the abdomen and pelvis, especially along the iliac veins and on the right-hand side. Biopsy of right pelvic lymph node (nearly 2 inches wide) reveals total necrosis of coagulative type. Chest x-ray is negative for lung cancer, cytotoxic exam of pleural effusion negative for cancer, cancer markers negative (though CA125 is 105). Off antibiotics on Jan 26, he gets dyspnea, cough, fever again: new hemocultures reveal staph epidermis, hominis, CVC infected with Acinetobacter Baumannii. Treated with Meropenem, Amikacin, Cubicin. Sent back home with an IV Cubicin therapy which he will finish tomorrow, he\u2019s very weak, low blood pressure and generally still feels unwell. If you've got any ideas, I will forever be grateful.",
    "document": "Combination Therapy for Diabetic Macular Edema\nDiabetic macular edema is a main reason for visual loss in diabetic patients. Until recent years, macular laser photocoagulation was the only available therapy. The awareness that inflammation is an important factor in the pathogenetic process of DME gave reason for intravitreal treatment with corticosteroids. The introduction of anti-VEGF drugs brought a revolutionary change in the treatment of DME. This paper will review the important clinical trials with an emphasis on combination therapies.",
    "response": "I'm not an ID doctor and obviously don't know all the scans but will take a stab.\n\nThe thing that jumps out to me is the fact that he is bacteremic with multiple coagulase negative staph organisms which are almost always found on skin (one thing to note is if they're contaminants...) but I'm assuming they grew out in multiple culture bottles. The other thing they're found on are prosthetic devices so has he ever had ANY prosthetic device insertion...heart valves, orthopedic replacements, etc. I'm assuming not but just have to ask.\n\nHow I then approach this is why is this gentleman getting multiple skin bacterial infections. One is if he has an open wound which would be obvious. Another is he has a fistula of some sort but hopefully they have scanned this guy up and down and would have spotted something.\n\nThe only thing left is actually the candida (common after chemo) you mentioned. I don't think he has a fungal bloodstream infection....they get VERY sick and he hasn't been treated with any anti-fungals. I'm assuming they drew fungal blood cultures at some point. I do think though that the candida wrecked the skin barrier that then predisposes him to these coagulase negative bacteremia.\n\nI'll give you a more classic example to illustrate. There are certain males that repeatedly get skin infections of the lower feet. They get treated with antibiotics again and again. Often the reason is because they have athletes foot which people ignore - the fungus disrupts the normal skin barrier allowing for bacteria to enter.\n\nIt's just a theory but hard to say otherwise without reviewing everything they have done (i also wonder if they did a nuclear study like tagged WBC to isolate source during active infection)"

    "question": "Hi. I\u2019m about to get my license, and thus will be asked if I want to be an organ donor. My initial reaction was of course yes, however, my parents insisted that I say no. They told me that if I\u2019m an organ donor and in the ER, doctors will not only let me die, but might even kill me. This sounded ridiculous so I did some research and for the most part found contradicting results to what they had claimed. However, I did find one article that kind of made me uneasy, but it sounds like total bullshit. Here\u2019s what it says;\n \n\u201cThe majority of organ donors are victims of head trauma, who end up being ruled dead based on brain-death criteria. And brain-death diagnosis isn't really an exact science:\n\nThe exam for brain death is simple. A doctor splashes ice water in your ears (to look for shivering in the eyes), pokes your eyes with a cotton swab and checks for any gag reflex, among other rudimentary tests. It takes less time than a standard eye exam. Finally, in what's called the apnea test, the ventilator is disconnected to see if you can breathe unassisted. If not, you are brain dead. (Some or all of the above tests are repeated hours later for confirmation.)\n\nHere's the weird part. If you fail the apnea test, your respirator is reconnected. You will begin to breathe again, your heart pumping blood, keeping the organs fresh. Doctors like to say that, at this point, the \"person\" has departed the body. You will now be called a BHC, or beating-heart cadaver.\nThe problem is, plenty of BHCs still have brain waves. A bigger problem is that\u2014very, very occasionally\u2014 BHC's even start breathing again by themselves. Whether they're actually dead or not, well, that's up for debate. \u201c\n\n\nTLDR; Many people may be declared dead when they\u2019re actually still functioning to harvest organs. \n\n\nIs any of this true? Is there any reputable case where someone was intentionally killed or left to die just to harvest organs? Thank you. \n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I don\u2019t believe that this information is true. I have the full intent of being an organ donor.",
    "document": "The diagnosis of brain death\nPhysicians, health care workers, members of the clergy, and laypeople throughout the world have accepted fully that a person is dead when his or her brain is dead. Although the widespread use of mechanical ventilators and other advanced critical care services have transformed the course of terminal neurologic disorders. Vital functions can now be maintained artificially for a long period of time after the brain has ceased to function. There is a need to diagnose brain death with utmost accuracy and urgency because of an increased awareness amongst the masses for an early diagnosis of brain death and the requirements of organ retrieval for transplantation. Physicians need not be, or consult with, a neurologist or neurosurgeon in order to determine brain death. The purpose of this review article is to provide health care providers in India with requirements for determining brain death, increase knowledge amongst health care practitioners about the clinical evaluation of brain death, and reduce the potential for variations in brain death determination policies and practices amongst facilities and practitioners. Process for brain death certification has been discussed under the following: 1. Identification of history or physical examination findings that provide a clear etiology of brain dysfunction. 2. Exclusion of any condition that might confound the subsequent examination of cortical or brain stem function. 3. Performance of a complete neurological examination including the standard apnea test and 10 minute apnea test. 4. Assessment of brainstem reflexes. 5. Clinical observations compatible with the diagnosis of brain death. 6. Responsibilities of physicians. 7. Notify next of kin. 8. Interval observation period. 9. Repeat clinical assessment of brain stem reflexes. 10. Confirmatory testing as indicated. 11. Certification and brain death documentation.",
    "response": "First off, what's on your license (in the USA) means nothing, because your next of kin have to give permission for organ harvesting. Permission is only solicited once the loss of brain function has been determined - this is colloquially called brain death. Until brain death is determined, all efforts are expended to keep the patient alive and preserve brain function. \n\nThe two final tests are the apnea test, which you described, and a cerebral angiogram, which measures blood flow to the brain. Both are extremely reliable and are considered to be determinative. The other tests you read about are preliminary. The chances of someone recovering meaningful brain function, let alone consciousness, after failing one of the final tests are zero.\n\nPatients who are declared brain dead are still treated with the utmost respect and dignity. We (health care professionals) know that this is someone's loved one and a life that is tragically lost. The focus does switch from preserving life, which is no longer possible, to preserving the organs; however, we still act respectfully.\n\nIt sounds like you've stumbled upon some misinformation, either deliberate or mistaken. Don't believe everything you read, make your own decision on the matter, and talk it over with your parents and loved ones so your wishes can be respected in the event of a tragedy."

    "document": "Ambiguity and uncertainty tolerance, need for cognition, and their association with stress. A study among Italian practicing physicians\nABSTRACT \n           Medical practice is inherently ambiguous and uncertain. The physicians\u2019 ability to tolerate ambiguity and uncertainty has been proved to have a great impact on clinical practice. The primary aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that higher degree of physicians\u2019 ambiguity and uncertainty intolerance and higher need for cognitive closure will predict higher work stress. Two hundred and twelve physicians (mean age\u00a0=\u00a042.94\u00a0years; SD\u00a0=\u00a010.72) from different medical specialties with different levels of expertise were administered a set of questionnaires measuring perceived levels of work-related stress, individual ability to tolerate ambiguity, stress deriving from uncertainty, and personal need for cognitive closure. A linear regression analysis was performed to examine which variables predict the perceived level of stress. The regression model was statistically significant [R 2 \u00a0=\u00a0.32; F(10,206)\u00a0=\u00a08.78, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.001], thus showing that, after controlling for gender and medical specialty, ambiguity and uncertainty tolerance, decisiveness (a dimension included in need for closure), and the years of practice were significant predictors of perceived work-related stress. Findings from the present study have some implications for medical education. Given the great impact that the individual ability to tolerate ambiguity and uncertainty has on the physicians\u2019 level of perceived work-related stress, it would be worth paying particular attention to such a skill in medical education settings. It would be crucial to introduce or to empower educational tools and strategies that could increase medical students\u2019 ability to tolerate ambiguity and uncertainty. \n           Abbreviations:  JSQ: Job stress questionnaire; NFCS: Need for cognitive closure scale; PRU: Physicians\u2019 reactions to uncertainty; TFA: Tolerance for ambiguity",

    "question": "The first two days, his only symptoms were a runny nose. He got tested and his answer came on the third day. We went to the doctor right away . oxygen levels had dropped from 95 to 87. CT showed that his lungs were 90% involved. His oxygen levels were 60-70 with BIPAP . Two weeks later at night it suddenly dropped to 20, the doctor intubated him. His oxygen levels were still 60-70. His heart beat was around 120 but it wasn\u2019t steady. His Systolic pressure dropped to 60 but came up to 100 mmHg using epinephrine. He lasted only two weeks. Two days on ventilator. The doctor said he had fibrosis. Why did this happen can anyone explain please. He was 76 years old and we did a complete check up two months before and he was perfectly healthy.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ll just quickly add these since others were asking. His test results during his time at the ICU weren\u2019t abnormal. Only his liver enzymes were a bit higher than usual.

    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

    "question": "Hi there, I made a Reddit account just to post on here because I\u2019m afraid to move forward with my ophthalmologist and his plans for my eye. Gonna try to make this as short as possible while also providing enough detail so you understand my case.\n\nBackground: I\u2019m a 25 y/o F with a diagnosis of keratoconus in both eyes since age 13. Right eye far more advanced than left. \n\nIn 2016 at age 22, my ophthalmologist urged me to get a corneal transplant in my right eye because the pressure was building and it was getting to the point where my cornea could perforate. His words, not mine. I got the surgery August of that year. In November while removing a small stitch, I moved and he accidentally cut the big suture that goes all around. I was taken back into the OR for a complete re-suturing of the graft. Slowly over the years he\u2019s been removing stitches again and in March of this year I had the last ones removed. Doctor said I may have little remnants in there that may itch at times, but I haven\u2019t felt anything. Following that March appt, I was to schedule a 6-month follow-up. That follow-up finally happened last month in October.\n\nAll these years at every appt he just quickly takes a look at my eye and says it\u2019s doing fine. So I was surprised to find at this follow-up that I have a pseudochamber that has somehow filled with fluid. \n\nThe way the doctor explained it was this: when I had the initial surgery, I had a tiny hole in my epithelium that he saw. He went ahead and finished the surgery knowing this hole was there and \u201chas been keeping an eye on it this whole time, hoping it would fix itself.\u201d The hole has caused my epithelium and the donor layer to separate, and now that pouch has fluid in it.\n\nThe plan going forward after that appt when I was notified of this issue was a drainage of the pseudochamber with an air bubble insertion; the air bubble was supposed to collapse the chamber and help the two layers come back together.\n\nTwo weeks ago I went for the pre-op appt to sign everything and have the procedure explained to me one more time. The doctor walked right in and said \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot about you and I think I should try a laser instead of the drainage and air bubble.\u201d He said my own epithelium is cloudy and collapsing the chamber might not help my vision at all, because the cloudiness will still be there. Instead, he wants to use a YAG laser to create a small hole in my cloudy epithelium right in front of my pupil, which will allow me to see more clearly, according to him. But what\u2019s weird to me is that that doesn\u2019t fix the fact that my epithelium and the donor epithelium are coming apart and that the chamber is filling with fluid, right? At this appt, he also changed his own words. Before he had told me my epithelium \u201chad a tiny hole\u201d but now he was saying that during surgery \u201cit\u2019s easy to accidentally hit something with the blade.\u201d It sounds like he accidentally made a cut he wasn\u2019t supposed to make and had previously tried to play it off like I was born with this hole in a layer below my cornea.\n\nI don\u2019t know how relevant this is, but the graft itself is also hazy along one of the edges. I saw an optometrist about a year ago just because I needed a new prescription quickly for some backup glasses, and that optometrist urged me to get a second opinion because grafts are supposed to be clear and mine is far from that. He said mine looked more like a graft rejection. \n\nThe cloudy vision is something I noticed this summer but I don\u2019t know exactly when it started. Also starting this summer I\u2019ve been having occasional pain. It\u2019s not terrible, it feels like irritation caused by dryness but I don\u2019t think my eye is dry at all.\n\nI was extremely upset when I found out about the pseudochamber two appts ago because the doctor said he\u2019s been keeping an eye on it yet I had never heard of it at all. Considering his assistant writes all the notes for him whenever he sees me, and considering the fact that I listen to everything (I\u2019m a nurse so it\u2019s not ALL medical jargon to me), I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to find that even though he\u2019s \u201cbeen keeping an eye on it\u201d there\u2019s probably no mention of it in my medical records. \n\nI need opinions on how you think I ended up with this complication, whether the laser thing is the best move (it\u2019s scheduled for 9 days from now), and whether you think my doctor is trying to cover his ass for a mistake he made that has left me with these problems. \n\nIt might be worth mentioning that he has the biggest ego of any doctor I know, he has the worst bedside manner, he\u2019s made me cry at least 4x over the years when he talks down to me. (He once cut my eyelid because I blinked while he was cutting a stitch, and when I started dripping blood he pushed his chair back, threw the blade on the table, and said \u201cI can\u2019t do this with you bleeding all over the place\u201d and walked out the room. That was the end of the visit. His assistant stayed with me while I cried and then walked me out to the front desk where I scheduled my next appt.) I am incredibly sensitive when having my eyes touched especially when I know there\u2019s a freaking blade in there, and he gives me attitude and tells me \u201cyou\u2019re a nurse, get over it.\u201d Yet even with his horrible personality, the last two visits he\u2019s acted different. He\u2019s more mellow, talks quieter, keeps reassuring me that he\u2019s gonna fix my eye. I really think his demeanor has changed because he knows he fucked up and feels the need to be nice.\n\nAlright, I know that wasn\u2019t short so I apologize. I really hope I can get some opinions on here.\n\n\nEDIT: Since this keeps coming up over and over and I missed it in my original post: I have Medicaid insurance. I live in a big city and in a very densely populated area. My whole life I\u2019ve always struggled with the system. If I were to call any of my clinic\u2019s locations and I said give me the soonest available appt with any PCP, that appt wouldn\u2019t be happening for another 2 months. The referral comes 2-3 weeks after that. Then by the time I call the specialist\u2019s office who knows when the next available appts are. I went through this with trying to see a neurologist recently, and I was so desperate to see the best of the best that some of my loved ones offered to pay out of pocket for me to get at least a consultation with a neurologist that specializes in what I was dealing with. When I called her office and said \u201cI know you don\u2019t take Medicaid but can I just get an appt and pay out of pocket?\u201d I was told that this is illegal and considered fraud! So as much as I would love to go see another cornea specialist I literally cannot!\n\nAs someone mentioned below, cornea specialists are very rare\u2014and in my city I think there are only two who take Medicaid. My ophthalmologist has always been an asshole, truly, but I stuck with him because I felt that he was competent and obviously he\u2019s been following my case for years. I trusted him. It wasn\u2019t until my last appt 2 weeks ago when he started going back on his word and changing his mind about how to move forward that I was alarmed. But by then I had already secured this job that starts in early January. I\u2019m relocating in mid-December, so going through a PCP and trying to get referred to the only other cornea specialist in my area that takes Medicaid just isn\u2019t an option. I don\u2019t have the time at this point.\n\nI super appreciate everyone\u2019s advice. I never thought my post would get this much attention.",
    "document": "Arylated analogues of cypronazole: fungicidal effect and activity on human fibroblasts. Docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations\nTriadimefon (TDM) and cyproconazole (CPZ) are two triazoles widely used as fungicides. Several azoles were synthesised starting from commercial TDM and CPZ. The compounds were evaluated against phytopathogenic filamentous fungi, including  Aspergillus fumigatus  (AF),  A. niger  (AN),  A. ustus (AU), A. japonicus  (AJ),  A. terreus (AT), Fusarium oxysporum  and  Botrytis cinerea  isolated from grapevine in the province of San Juan, Argentina. Three of the synthesised compounds (1-(Biphenyl-4-yloxy)-3,3-dimethyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butan-2-one,  1 ; 2-(Biphenyl-4-yl)-3-cyclopropyl-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)butan-2-ol,  3 ; 3-Cyclopropyl-2-(4\u2019-fluorobiphenyl-4-yl)-1-(1H-1,2,4-triazol1-yl)butan-2-ol,  4 ) presented remarkable in vitro fungicidal properties ,  with better effects than TDM and CPZ on some of the target fungi. Cytotoxicity was assessed using human lung fibroblasts MRC5. Derivative  1 , with IC 50  values of 389.4\u00a0\u00b5M, was less toxic towards MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts than commercial TDM (248.5\u00a0\u00b5M) and CPZ (267.4\u00a0\u00b5M). Docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the compounds present the same interaction in the binding pocket of the CYP51B enzyme and with the same amino acids as CPZ.

Suffer from an uncommon form of acute kidney injury known as dietary hyperoxaluria. Today I found out my kidneys have worsened, and I'm really unsure as to why. Don't think it was oxalates but protein. My nephrologist said that for kidney disease (can't remember if she said for all kinds) restricting protein was no longer considered necessary, however every resource I look up says otherwise.

    "document": "Dietary Protein Intake and Chronic Kidney Disease\nPurpose of review \n             High protein intake may lead to increased intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyperfiltration. This can cause damage to glomerular structure leading to or aggravating chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hence, a low protein diet (LPD) of 0.6\u20130.8 g/kg/day is often recommended for the management of CKD. We reviewed the effect of protein intake on incidence and progression of CKD and the role of LPD the CKD management. \n           \n           \n             Recent findings \n             Actual dietary protein consumption in CKD patients remain substantially higher than the recommendations for LPD. Notwithstanding the inconclusive results of the  Modification of Diet in Renal Disease  (MDRD) study, the largest randomized controlled trial to examine protein restriction in CKD, several prior and subsequent studies and meta-analyses including secondary analyses of the MDRD data appear to support the role of LPD on retarding progression of CKD and delaying initiation of maintenance dialysis therapy. LPD can also be used to control metabolic derangements in CKD. Supplemented LPD with essential amino acids or their keto-analogs may be used for incremental transition to dialysis especially in non-dialysis days. An LPD management in lieu of dialysis therapy can reduce costs, enhance psychological adaptation, and preserve residual renal function upon transition to dialysis. Adherence and adequate protein and energy intake should be ensured to avoid protein-energy wasting. \n           \n           \n             Summary \n             A balanced and individualized dietary approach based on LPD should be elaborated with periodic dietitian counselling and surveillance to optimize management of CKD, to assure adequate protein and energy intake and to avoid or correct protein-energy wasting.",
    "response": "Part of the job of the kidneys is to remove nitrogen waste products. Nitrogen waste is primarily generated by protein metabolism and excess protein intake can lead to elevated nitrogen levels in the blood, in the form of urea. Elevated levels do not damage the kidney or change the kidney function, it's just a result of the poor kidney function. There was a time when the recommendation was to avoid protein intake, but as your nephrologist stated, this really isn't a major concern these days. Urea is one of the slowest toxins in the body that will build up to concerning levels. If your kidney function is so bad that urea accumulation could be a problem, something else will become a problem first."

In this study, PP nanocomposites were fabricated to reduce the moisture absorption of PP composites in automotive headlamp housings. Alkylated chemically modified graphene (CMG-R) was synthesized to reduce the surface hydrophilicity of graphene and increase compatibility with the PP matrix. Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were performed to analyze the nanofillers. X-ray diffraction was performed to determine the interlayer spacing of the nanofiller resulting from surface treatment. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to analyze the crystallinity of the nanocomposites. The results indicated that the improved hydrophobicity of the nanofiller due to alkylation reduced the maximum moisture absorption of the PP nanocomposites by 15% compared to PP composites. The findings of this study are useful for reducing fogging in automotive headlamps.",
    "response": "Skin infections are generally easy to clear and the finding of Staphylococcus on the skin does not imply infection. Staphylococcus aureus is found in atopic dermatitis skin, and is rapidly eliminated with clearing the dermatitis. I suspect that you have been misdiagnosed. Long-term use of cosrticosteroids, especially medium-potency topical corticosteroids (triamcinolone) is inadvisable because it causes thinning of the skin. ( Once thinned, the skin is then much more easily irritated, and the cycle does not stop. Consider switching to noncorticosteroidal treatment such as tacrolimus, pimecrolimus or crisaborole. If the problem continues after one or two months of continuous use of a noncorticosteroidal product, a skin biopsy may be helpful."

The primary end point assessment was a noninferiority comparison of baricitinib monotherapy to MTX monotherapy based on the proportion of patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology 20% improvement criteria (achieving an ACR20 response) at week 24. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The study met its primary objective. Moreover, baricitinib monotherapy was found to be superior to MTX monotherapy at week 24, with a higher ACR20 response rate (77% versus 62%;  P \u2009\u2264\u20090.01). Similar results were observed for combination therapy. Compared to MTX monotherapy, significant improvements in disease activity and physical function were observed for both baricitinib groups as early as week 1. Radiographic progression was reduced in both baricitinib groups compared to MTX monotherapy; the difference was statistically significant for baricitinib plus MTX. The rates of serious adverse events (AEs) were similar across treatment groups, while rates of some treatment\u2010emergent AEs, including infections, were increased with baricitinib plus MTX. Three deaths were reported, all occurring in the MTX monotherapy group.

Very little is known, however, regarding the effect of this drug on the adult brain. Regions of the brain that may be susceptible to RA are those that continue to generate new neurons. In the adult mouse, neurogenesis is maintained in the hippocampus and subventricular zone. This report demonstrates that a clinical dose (1 mg/kg/day) of 13- cis -RA in mice significantly reduces cell proliferation in the hippocampus and the subventricular zone, suppresses hippocampal neurogenesis, and severely disrupts capacity to learn a spatial radial maze task.

    "document": "Inter-relationships between isotretinoin treatment and psychiatric disorders: Depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, psychosis and suicide risks\nIsotretinoin (Accutane) is a treatment for severe acne that is resistant to other forms of treatment, including antibiotics and topical treatments. The prescription of this drug has been controversial ever since its initial marketing in 1982. It is the only non-psychotropic drug in the Food and Drug Administration top 10 drugs found to be associated with depression. Recently, Bremner et al published an extensive review (until 2010) of the evidence for the association of retinoic acid (RA) with depression and suicide. Some patients who are admitted in psychiatric hospitals report a history of present or past treatment with isotretinoin. Then, the imputability of the molecule in the occurrence of disorders represents necessarily an important question for both professionals and their patients. This paper aims to specify the links between the drug and specific psychiatric disorders. A review of the literature related to isotretinoin, RA, vitamin A, depression, suicide, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, schizophrenia was performed. Many studies demonstrated an increased risk of depression, attempted suicide and suicide following isotretinoin treatment. However, isotretinoin may have an antidepressant impact, according to some dermatological papers. They consider treating acne with this efficient treatment could improve self-image and make the patient feel better. Several studies showed that patients with bipolar disorder had an increased risk for a clinical exacerbation of symptoms undergoing treatment with isotretinoin. A few studies also seem to suggest a possible link between isotretinoin and psychosis. Nonetheless, studies point out a link between retinoid dysregulation and schizophrenia through modulation of dopamine receptors. From this review, we propose guidelines for isotretinoin prescription to healthcare professionals.",

After doing every scan and test known to humankind, I started physical therapy a few months ago, which is helping, but slowly.\n\nTwo years ago I was diagnosed with very high prolactin, for which I am taking Cabergoline three times a week. I also have insomnia recently which I am aware can raise prolactin even more. One thing I have noticed for months is that some days my pain is so severe that I cannot get out of bed. I am in so much pain those days I cannot walk, I cannot concentrate even working from home, and I cannot do my physical therapy. These things in turn make me depressed and also make my sleep even worse. Other days my pain is much more manageable and I not only can I do my physical therapy but can often walk with a cane a block or more, and can do a fair amount of movement. I finally realized that the days I have more movement are the same days I take the Cabergoline when I wake up. The difference was very noticeable as soon as I figured this out.\n\nI have never experienced any side effects from this medication but when I went to the doctor, not only does she not want to prescribe a higher dose, but wants me to go off the medication because it can sometimes cause heart problems after longtime use, at much higher doses. I am at a loss at what to do. She is concerned, understandably, about a small-medium chance of heart problems in the future, but without this medication that doesn't matter to me.

While most often caused by acquired somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells, the presence of familial clustering in MPD cases suggests that inheritance is an important factor in the etiology of this disease. Though far less common than sporadic disease, inherited MPDs can be clinically indistinguishable from sporadic disease. Recently, germline mutations in Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) and  MPL , two genes frequently mutated in sporadic MPD, have been shown to cause inherited thrombocytosis. Study of the function of these mutant proteins has led to a new understanding of the biological mechanisms that produce myeloproliferative disease. In this review, we summarize the data regarding inherited mutations that cause or predispose to MPDs, with a focus on the biological effects of mutant proteins. We propose that defining inherited MPDs in this manner has the potential to simplify diagnosis in a group of disorders that can be difficult to differentiate clinically.",

We discovered a protein, Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that associates with the 53BP1 Tudor domain and prevents its recruitment to DSBs. Here we elucidate how TIRR impacts 53BP1 function beyond its recruitment to DSBs and biochemically links the two distinct roles of 53BP1. Loss of TIRR causes an aberrant increase in p53\u2019s gene transactivation function, impacting several p53-mediated cell-fate programs. TIRR inhibits the complex formation between the Tudor domain of 53BP1 and a dimethylated form of p53 (K382me2) that is poised for transcriptional activation of its target genes.

    "question": "Updated 6th April\n\nThe below comes from multiple sources as well as the direct experiences of myself and my colleagues.\n\nIf you would like more information I highly recommend this free e-book written by two German physicians, it is available in multiple languages and is very up to date: \n\n\n**Is it really as bad as they say?**\n\nYes. This is the most serious public health crisis of the last hundred years. By the time this is over many thousands will have died before their time. Do not underestimate the effect this will have on global society \n\n**These are my symptoms, do I have COVID-19?**\n\nRight now (assuming you live in an endemic country) any infective symptoms are COVID-19 until proven otherwise. Such symptoms may include any or all of:\n\n- Fever\n- Cough (productive or dry)\n- Fatigue\n- Muscle aches (particularly chest pain)\n- Sore throat\n- Swollen glands\n- Loss of sense of taste or smell\n- Diarrhoea \n\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list. Take home message: if you\u2019re not sure assume you have it and quarantine appropriately.\n\n**When should I seek medical attention?**\n\nAny breathing difficulties should be discussed with a doctor. This may be breathlessness at rest or on exertion, such as climbing the stairs. If you\u2019re struggling to do the things you normally do then seek assessment.\n\nYou should have a low threshold for seeking assessment if you are at high risk of exposure, for example if you\u2019re a healthcare worker.\n\n**I have no symptoms, should I stay at home?**\n\nYes. \n\nAt this moment you must stay at home. You must only go to work if your job is essential for the running of the country or your local health service (although I accept not every country has introduced income support for those who have to stay at home. \n\nDon\u2019t see anyone socially unless you live together. \n\nIf you do go out for work or supplies then stay at least 2m away from other people. Do not touch each other. Wash your hands religiously.\n\n**What treatments are there?**\n\nSo far nothing.\n\nEither you get it and your recover, or you develop ARDS, in which case you will need to be admitted to ICU and ventilated.\n\nChloroquine/hydroxychloroqine inhibits the ACE2 receptor in your cells, this is the path the virus takes you infect you. There is, to my knowledge, no published data at this time suggesting that it makes any difference.\n\nThere are multiple trials into antiviral medications but again nothing has been published to my knowledge (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong).\n\n**Am I high risk?**\n\nThe majority of people who get C-19 will have a mild disease. A minority will develop severe disease that requires ventilation and may lead to death.\n\nThe biggest risk factor for developing severe C-19 is age. Below the age of 50 the disease is rarely severe. In children it is almost always mild. The groups most at risk are the over 70s and over 80s.\n\nAs mentioned earlier there is some suggestion that higher viral exposure (such as experienced by healthcare workers) may lead to a more severe disease course. \n\nIn terms of other medical problems some people should take extra precautions. Those receiving cancer treatment or taking immunosuppressants are at greater risk. Asthma seems to convey greater risk but mainly among those with more severe disease (such as those on biologic treatments, daily prednisone or those who have previously been admitted to intensive care). \n\nMen seem to be at higher risk of severe disease. We don\u2019t know why.\n\nOther conditions may have implications. If you are curious about your personal risk due to a comorbidity there is lots of useful information on patients\u2019 charity websites, for example asthma UK.\n\n**I have elderly relatives, what should I do?**\n\n1) Everything you can do to facilitate them staying at home away from others. If you live with them avoid them as much as possible.\n\n2) Talk to them now about what they would want if they got COVID and got sick with it. Would they want an ventilator? Would they want ICU? Over here hospital inpatients aren\u2019t being allowed visitors. Admission may mean dying alone, on an intensive care unit with no one allowed to see you. It\u2019s a hard discussion but better that everyone knows what everyone wants now. \n\n**What is it?**\n\nCOVID-19 means coronavirus disease 19 (as it was first reported to the WHO on NYE in 2019). It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).\n\n**Why is it spreading so fast?**\n\nCOVID-19 is very contagious. Current data suggests an R0 (that is the number of people an infected person will go onto infect) of 2.5-3. By comparison your average seasonal flu with have an R0 of about 1.3. To put this into perspective, if you start with 10 people infected with seasonal flu, over ten infection cycles you\u2019ll end up with about 138 infected people. With COVID-19 over the same ten cycles you\u2019ll end up with tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of infected people. Bear in mind this is not what is going to happen, only what could happen if the a disease was left to spread without effort to slow it. Public health measures to contain it can massively reduce the actual transmission rate.\n\n**Can I find out if I\u2018ve had it already?**\n\nRight now no.\nThere is a test in development.\n\n**What can I do to minimise my risk?**\n\nWash your hands. Regularly. Avoid large gatherings. Follow local rules and guidance. If you have symptoms then stay away from other people.\n\nTo my knowledge there is no evidence that wearing a surgical mask in public will be of any benefit.\n\n**Should I stop taking my medication?**\n\nThere have been media reports that people taking certain types of mediation, specifically ACE inhibitors/A2RBs (eg ramipril/losartan) or NSAIDs (eg ibuprofen) are at higher risk of catching or complications of COVID. To my knowledge there is no good data to support this. You should continue to take your medication as normal unless instructed otherwise by your doctor.",
    "document": "Ultraviolet Irradiation of Blood: \u201cThe Cure That Time Forgot\u201d?\nUltraviolet blood irradiation (UBI) was extensively used in the 1940s and 1950s to treat many diseases including septicemia, pneumonia, tuberculosis, arthritis, asthma and even poliomyelitis. The early studies were carried out by several physicians in USA and published in the American Journal of Surgery. However with the development of antibiotics, UBI use declined and it has now been called \u201cthe cure that time forgot\u201d. Later studies were mostly performed by Russian workers and in other Eastern countries and the modern view in Western countries is that UBI remains highly controversial. \n           This chapter discusses the potential of UBI as an alternative approach to current methods used to treat infections, as an immune-modulating therapy and as a method for normalizing blood parameters. No resistance of microorganisms to UV irradiation has been reported, and multi- antibiotic resistant strains are as susceptible as their wild-type counterparts. Low and mild doses of UV kill microorganisms by damaging the DNA, while any DNA damage in host cells can be rapidly repaired by DNA repair enzymes. However the use of UBI to treat septicemia cannot be solely due to UV-mediated killing of bacteria in the blood-stream, as only 5\u20137% of blood volume needs to be treated with UV to produce the optimum benefit. UBI may enhance the phagocytic capacity of various phagocytic cells (neutrophils and dendritic cells), inhibit lymphocytes, and oxidize blood lipids. The oxidative nature of UBI may have mechanisms in common with ozone therapy and other oxygen therapies. There may be some similarities to extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) using psoralens and UVA irradiation. However there are differences between UBI and ECP in that UBI tends to stimulate the immune system, while ECP tends to be immunosuppressive. With the recent emergence of bacteria that are resistant to all known antibiotics, UBI should be more investigated as an alternative approach to infections, and as an immune-modulating therapy.",

Classifying into primary (true) and secondary cysts (pseudocysts), true cysts contain cellular epithelial lining and subdivided into parasitic and non-parasitic cysts. This study aimed to determine the outcome of treatment in patients with splenic cyst. \n           \n           \n             Methods: \n             All patients with splenic cyst who had been treated in Department of General Surgery of Ghaem and Omid teaching hospitals over a 24-year period were identified.

Fifteen cases had true cyst including 11 parasitic cysts (hydatid) and only one pseudocyst. 37.5% of the splenic cysts had coexistent cysts in liver, pelvis, omentum and paracolic regions. Nine patients underwent total splenectomy and 5 cases partial splenectomy and 2 remaining cases received conservative medical treatment. The size of the cysts varied from 6 to 25 centimeter with average size of 14.3 centimeter.

    "document": "Comparative accuracy of CT perfusion in diagnosing acute ischemic stroke: A systematic review of 27 trials\nObjective \n             To systematically evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy of CT perfusion (CTP), non-enhanced computed tomography (NCCT) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) in detecting acute ischemic stroke. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We searched seven databases and screened the reference lists of the included studies. The risk of bias in the study quality was assessed using QUADASII. We produced paired forest plots in RevMan to show the variation of the sensitivity and specificity estimates together with their 95% CI. We used a hierarchical summary ROC model to summarize the sensitivity and specificity of CTP in detecting ischemic stroke. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             We identified 27 studies with a total of 2168 patients. The pooled sensitivity of CTP for acute ischemic stroke was 82% (95% CI 75\u201388%), and the specificity was 96% (95% CI 89\u201399%). CTP was more sensitive than NCCT and had a similar accuracy with CTA. There were no statistically significant differences in the sensitivity and specificity between patients who underwent CTP within 6 hours of symptom onset and beyond 6 hours after symptom onset. No adverse events were reported in the included studies. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             CTP is more accurate than NCCT and has similar accuracy to CTA in detecting acute ischemic stroke. However, the evidence is not strong. There is potential benefit of using CTP to select stroke patients for treatment, but more high-quality evidence is needed to confirm this result.",

LH is produced by the pituitary gland to stimulate testosterone production in the testicles. FSH is also produced in the pituitary, and together with testosterone this triggers sperm production. Both LH and testosterone are normal in your lab values, but FSH is not.\n\nIn the seminiferous tubules there are normally 2 types of cells, Leydig cells which respond to LH, and Sertoli cells which respond to FSH. As LH is responded to by the Leydig cells, they produce inhibin, which triggers the pituitary to stop producing FSH.\n\nNow, in your case, FSH production doesn't seem to be inhibited. A possible diagnosis could be a syndrome called 'Sertoli cell only syndrome'. In this syndrome, there are no (or not enough) Leydig cells in the seminiferous tubules to produce inhibin and FSH production doesn't stop. Associated with this is azoospermia. There is no one cause for this syndrome (it could be genetic or caused by external factors), and there is no treatment for it.\n\nThis is the only thing I can find about azoospermia with high FSH and normal LH, but to get a definite diagnosis you'd need to have a testicular biopsy taken and sent to a pathology lab.\n\nP.S.: I'd like you to keep me updated, as researching this has really piqued my interest.

Some of these disorders include cervical dystonia, post-stroke spasticity, blepharospasm, migraine, and hyperhidrosis. Botulinum neurotoxins also have varying governmental approvals for cosmetic applications. As botulinum neurotoxin therapy is often continued over many years, some patients may develop detectable antibodies that may or may not affect their biological activity. Although botulinum neurotoxins are considered \u201clower risk\u201d biologics since antibodies that may develop are not likely to cross react with endogenous proteins, it is possible that patients may lose their therapeutic response. Various factors impact the immunogenicity of botulinum neurotoxins, including product-related factors such as the manufacturing process, the antigenic protein load, and the presence of accessory proteins, as well as treatment-related factors such as the overall toxin dose, booster injections, and prior vaccination or exposure. Detection of antibodies by laboratory tests does not necessarily predict the clinical success or failure of treatment. Overall, botulinum neurotoxin type A products exhibit low clinically detectable levels of antibodies when compared with other approved biologic products.

Cardiovascular dynamics in women during the menstrual cycle and oral contraceptive therapy.  Measurements of pulmonary blood flow and cardiac output have been made in 31 healthy women during the follicular and luteal phases of their menstrual cycle using nitrous oxide whole body plethysmography. The women were divided into three groups: 12 women were receiving oestrogen-progestogen contraceptive pills, 8 were receiving progestogen-only pills, and 11 were using either alternative methods of contraception or none at all. There was no significant difference in the values of cardiac index, pulmonary arterial distensibility, heart rate or systemic blood pressure during the two phases of the menstrual cycle in any of the three groups. When the three groups were compared the cardiac output showed the most significant difference, being greatest in the oestrogen-progestogen group, the progestogen-only group occupying an intermediate position. An increased cardiac output might play a part in the development of systemic hypertension in some women receiving oral contraceptives and could also add a risk to women with pre-existing heart disease.",

    "document": "Defective Expression and Function of the Leukocyte Associated Ig-like Receptor 1 in B Lymphocytes from Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Patients\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by the production of a wide array of autoantibodies and dysregulation of B cell function. The leukocyte associated Immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor (LAIR)1 is a transmembrane molecule belonging to Ig superfamily which binds to different types of collagen. Herein, we have determined the expression and function of LAIR1 on B lymphocyte from SLE patients. LAIR1 expression in peripheral blood B lymphocytes from 54 SLE, 24 mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 20 systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, 14 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 40 sex and age matched healthy donors (HD) have been analyzed by immunofluorescence. The effect of LAIR1 ligation by specific monoclonal antibodies, collagen or collagen producing mesenchymal stromal cells from reactive lymph nodes or bone marrow on Ig production by pokeweed mitogen and B cell receptor (BCR)-mediated NF-kB activation was assessed by ELISA and TransAM assay. The percentage of CD20 +  B lymphocytes lacking or showing reduced expression of LAIR1 was markedly increased in SLE and MCTD but not in SSc or RA patients compared to HD. The downregulation of LAIR1 expression was not dependent on corticosteroid therapy. Interestingly, LAIR1 engagement by collagen or collagen-producing mesenchymal stromal cells in SLE patients with low LAIR1 expression on B cells delivered a lower inhibiting signal on Ig production. In addition, NF-kB p65 subunit activation upon BCR and LAIR1 co-engagement was less inhibited in SLE patients than in HD. Our findings indicate defective LAIR1 expression and function in SLE B lymphocytes, possible contributing to an altered control of B lymphocytes behavior.",

    "document": "Biological relevance of ZNF224 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication IN NF-kB pathway regulation\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, whose presentation and clinical course are highly variable. Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",

    "question": "32, male, 178 cm, 72 kg, swedish, 10 years, adhd.\n\nI have had bouts of feeling generally unwell. Like I'm sick with the flu or a cold, but without any specific cold symptoms like a runny nose. Just \"under the weather\"; tiredness, diffuse pains in joints and muscles, lack of energy, lethargy, and generally feeling like I'm an old man rather than what feels appropriate at 32.\n\nI went to the doctor and a billion appointments later, it seems I have an abnormal anti CCP levels, 20 ish vs normal upper limit of 5. Apparently this is very specific to rheumatoid arthritis. \n\n**BUT** I don't have any arthritis. Yet. Now, I do have joint and tendon pains regularly, for no apparent reason, but it never gets \"out of hand\". It's typically a mild discomfort and pain for a few months and then it goes away. Never gets to the point of swelling up or being noticeably hot or anything. Just stiffness and mild pain and discomfort.\n\nIt comes and goes, it's bad for a week, then sort of fine for 2 weeks, repeat. What worries me is that the general level keeps getting worse, and it's been happening mostly over the last few years. I never feel quite OK anymore, just varying degrees of deathly tiredness and diffuse pains in random places. I think a normal person might be able to handle it, but my ADHD has always worked in such a way that even if I'm just mildly sick, my brain goes AWOL, and everything about the ADHD gets so much worse. Apparently my body is reacting to this as if it were an illness like any other, meaning I'm in constant ADHD hell.\n\nI've done ultrasound examinations of joints and xrays etc, and there's nothing remarkable going on there. That makes sense to me, because at the current state I wouldn't say I have any joint inflammations bad enough to be considered a problem. Yeah, there's mild pain constantly, and it's a little bit worse sometimes, but it's honestly no big deal.\n\nMy *problem* is that I'm fucking mentally wrecked by this. The constant state of mild inflammation is causing my ADHD issues to rise to unprecedented levels. I cannot fucking *think*. I'm an absolute mess, I'm lethargic and super tired all the time and I feel like I just want to be left the hell alone and sleep for a year or something. Everything is a huge chore. I cannot live like this.\n\nThe doctor cannot prescribe any RA meds, because without arthritis I can't get an RA diagnosis even though they agree that everything points to me getting RA sooner or later.\n\nThat makes sense I guess, can't really argue with that. But I also can't live like this. Are there any medications that might reduce the systemic inflammation in RA, or the tiredness, rather than focus on the joint damage/arthritis?",
    "document": "Managing Rheumatoid Arthritis with Dietary Interventions\nSelf-help by means of dietary interventions can help in management of various disorders including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a debilitating autoimmune disease. Dietary interventions necessitate a widespread appeal for both patients as well as clinicians due to factors including affordability, accessibility, and presence of scientific evidences that demonstrate substantial benefits in reducing disease symptoms such as pain, joint stiffness, swelling, tenderness and associated disability with disease progression. However, there is still an uncertainty among the community about the therapeutic benefits of dietary manipulations for RA. In the present review, we provide an account of different diets and their possible molecular mechanism of actions inducing observed therapeutic benefits for remission and management of RA. We further indicate food that can be a potential aggravating factor for the disease or may help in symptomatic relief. We thereafter summarize and thereby discuss various diets and food which help in reducing levels of inflammatory cytokines in RA patients that may play an effective role in management of RA following proper patient awareness. We thus would like to promote diet management as a tool that can both supplement and complement present treatment strategies for a better patient health and recovery.",
    "response": "Hello and I'm sorry that you are dealing with this. A positive CCP antibody may be present for years without manifesting as RA. It is not a situation where you are at the whim of random events. You can have some control, by doing things that improve your health and immune function. \n\nGet enough sleep and have a regular routine. Melatonin improves T-cell production in the early hours of sleep. Your brain makes melatonin as part of the diurnal changes associated with sleep and waking. Part of the problem in RA is a disruption of the sleep-wake rhythm and the H-P-A hormones. Melatonin can be supplemented safely in nearly everyone. It can be used to promote a more regular and consistent sleep, with additional benefits on immune function. It's not likely to be harmful if it doesn't do anything for you. \n\nSome people find that certain foods aggravate their symptoms, such as nightshade family, gluten, cow's milk, soy, etc. There was positive preliminary data presented to the American College of Rheumatology last year about the effects of an anti-inflammatory diet strategy on symptoms of patients with RA. Here's a review from a few years ago:\n\n\n\nKeep your teeth clean and see your dentist regularly. Dental health is clearly linked to RA onset as well as to overall general health. Take care of your teeth. \n\nDon't smoke. Stop smoking if you do smoke. This obviously means tobacco, but it also includes anything that is smoke, including air pollution, wood smoke, Marijuana use, etc. Don't vape. Keep your lungs from having to process particulates or poisonous gasses. Lots of data shows increased onset in people with environmental pulmonary exposures, especially smoking tobacco products.\n\nLastly, exercise. Keep your body fit, limber, and strong. Don't push to hard. You don't need to be a competitive athlete. Work up to working out at a moderate level, with 30 minutes a day as initial goal. \n\nTalk to your rheumatologist about this advice.

Additionally anxiety disorders represent a significant cost to the health care system as well as employers through benefits coverage and days missed due to incapacity. This study sought to explore the effectiveness of naturopathic care on anxiety symptoms using a randomized trial. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Employees with moderate to severe anxiety of longer than 6 weeks duration were randomized based on age and gender to receive naturopathic care (NC) (n\u200a=\u200a41) or standardized psychotherapy intervention (PT) (n\u200a=\u200a40) over a period of 12 weeks. Blinding of investigators and participants during randomization and allocation was maintained. Participants in the NC group received dietary counseling, deep breathing relaxation techniques, a standard multi-vitamin, and the herbal medicine, ashwagandha ( Withania somnifera ) (300 mg b.i.d. standardized to 1.5% withanolides, prepared from root). The PT intervention received psychotherapy, and matched deep breathing relaxation techniques, and placebo. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and secondary outcome measures included the Short Form 36 (SF-36), Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI), and Measure Yourself Medical Outcomes Profile (MY-MOP) to measure anxiety, mental health, and quality of life respectively. Participants were blinded to the placebo-controlled intervention. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Seventy-five participants (93%) were followed for 8 or more weeks on the trial. Final BAI scores decreased by 56.5% (p<0.0001) in the NC group and 30.5% (p<0.0001) in the PT group. BAI group scores were significantly decreased in the NC group compared to PT group (p\u200a=\u200a0.003). Significant differences between groups were also observed in mental health, concentration, fatigue, social functioning, vitality, and overall quality of life with the NC group exhibiting greater clinical benefit. No serious adverse reactions were observed in either group. \n           \n           \n             Relevance \n             Many patients seek alternatives and/or complementary care to conventional anxiety treatments. To date, no study has evaluated the potential of a naturopathic treatment protocol to effectively treat anxiety. Knowledge of the efficacy, safety or risk of natural health products, and naturopathic treatments is important for physicians and the public in order to make informed decisions. \n           \n           \n             Interpretation \n             Both NC and PT led to significant improvements in patients' anxiety. Group comparison demonstrated a significant decrease in anxiety levels in the NC group over the PT group. Significant improvements in secondary quality of life measures were also observed in the NC group as compared to PT. The whole system of naturopathic care for anxiety needs to be investigated further including a closer examination of the individual components within the context of their additive effect. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             Controlled-Trials.com  ISRCTN78958974",

    "document": "Murine lambda gene rearrangements: the stochastic model prevails over the ordered model.\nThe ontogeny of the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement in mammalian B cells seems to be ordered. Heavy chain gene segments rearrange first, followed by light chain gene segments, kappa before lambda. The genomic organization of murine lambda locus does not preclude the simultaneous expression of two subtypes from the same chromosome. In order to distinguish between an ordered and a stochastic model of rearrangement, a panel of 67 B cell hybridomas secreting either lambda 1, lambda 2, lambda 3 or lambda x (recently described) were analysed for V lambda J lambda rearrangements. The results show that in 97% of cases, a single rearrangement occurred, favouring the stochastic model over the ordered one. Strikingly, the possibility of having a productive rearrangement if the first try results in an aberrant one is rare. We propose therefore, that the lambda Ig is not necessarily required to ensure allelic and subtypic exclusion mechanisms. Moreover, in 97% of the cases, at least one kappa allele is rearranged. Furthermore, the RS recombination has been detected in 77% of the cases. This suggests that, although the stimulation of kappa precedes that of lambda locus, the RS recombination acts as a transacting albeit dispensable lambda activator. \n           \n             Images \n             \n               Fig. 2. \n               \n             \n             \n               Fig. 3.",

Over the last few decades, there has been increased experience with PN, and with this knowledge more information about the management of trace elements has become available. There is increasing awareness of the effects of deficiencies and toxicities of certain trace elements. Despite this heightened awareness, much is still unknown in terms of trace element monitoring, the accuracy of different assays, and current TE contamination of solutions. The supplementation of TEs is a complex and important part of the PN prescription. Understanding the role of different disease states and the need for reduced or increased doses is essential. Given the heterogeneity of the PN patients, supplementation should be individualized.",

    "document": "Trace Element Provision in Parenteral Nutrition in Children: One Size Does Not Fit All\nRoutine administration of trace elements is recognised as a standard of care in children requiring parenteral nutrition. However, there is a lack of global consensus regarding trace elements provision and dosing in pediatric parenteral nutrition. This review provides an overview of available evidence regarding trace elements supply and posology in parenteral nutrition in neonates and children. Trace elements provision in children should be tailored to the weight and clinical condition of the child with emphasis on those at risk of toxicity or deficiency. Based on current evidence, there is a need to review the formulation of commercial solutions that contain multiple-trace elements and to enable individual trace elements additives to be available for specific indications. Literature supports the removal of chromium provision whereas manganese and molybdenum supplementation are debated. Preterm neonates may have higher parenteral requirements in iodine, selenium and copper than previously recommended. There is growing support for the routine provision of iron in long-term parenteral nutrition. Further studies on trace elements contamination of parenteral nutrition solutions are needed for a range of trace elements.",

Some patients who receive this diagnosis subsequently turn out to have a disease that explains their initial presentation. We aimed to determine how frequently this misdiagnosis occurs, and whether it has become less common since the widespread availability of brain imaging. \n           Design  Systematic review. \n           Data sources  Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cinahl databases, and searches of reference lists. \n           Review methods  We included studies published since 1965 on the diagnostic outcome of adults with motor and sensory symptoms unexplained by disease. We critically appraised these papers, and carried out a multivariate, random effect, meta-analysis of the data. \n           Results  Twenty seven studies including a total of 1466 patients and a median duration of follow-up of five years were eligible for inclusion. Early studies were of poor quality. There was a significant (P < 0.02) decline in the mean rate of misdiagnosis from the 1950s to the present day; 29% (95% confidence interval 23% to 36%) in the 1950s; 17% (12% to 24%) in the 1960s; 4% (2% to 7%) in the 1970s; 4% (2% to 6%) in the 1980s; and 4% (2% to 6%) in the 1990s. This decline was independent of age, sex, and duration of symptom in people included in the studies. \n           Conclusions  A high rate of misdiagnosis of conversion symptoms was reported in early studies but this rate has been only 4% on average in studies of this diagnosis since 1970. This decline is probably due to improvements in study quality rather than improved diagnostic accuracy arising from the introduction of computed tomography of the brain.",

We compared between-group differences in gray matter volume using voxel-based morphometry across the whole brain. All participants in addition underwent a thorough neuropsychological battery, including the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression Scales and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. To determine whether confounding factors such as comorbid depression, anxiety, or childhood trauma exposure contributed to the observed structural changes, nonparametric correlation analysis was performed. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Patients with functional movement disorders exhibited increased volume of the left amygdala, left striatum, left cerebellum, left fusiform gyrus, and bilateral thalamus, and decreased volume of the left sensorimotor cortex (whole-brain corrected  p  \u2264 0.05).

To address the underlying mechanism, we develop cerebral organoid models using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with  APOE  \u03b53/\u03b53 or \u03b54/\u03b54 genotype from individuals with either normal cognition or AD dementia. Cerebral organoids from AD patients carrying  APOE  \u03b54/\u03b54 show greater apoptosis and decreased synaptic integrity.

Transcriptomics analysis by RNA-sequencing reveals that cerebral organoids from AD patients are associated with an enhancement of stress granules and disrupted RNA metabolism. Importantly, isogenic conversion of  APOE4  to  APOE3  attenuates\u00a0the  APOE4 -related phenotypes in cerebral organoids from AD patients.

    "document": "Cross-Reactive Results in Serological Tests for Borreliosis in Patients with Active Viral Infections\nCurrently, serological tests for Lyme disease (LD), routinely performed in laboratories following the European Concerted Action on Lyme Borreliosis recommendations as part of two-stage diagnostics, are often difficult to interpret. This concerns both the generation of false positive and negative results, which frequently delay the correct diagnosis and implementation of appropriate treatment. The above problems result from both morphological and antigenic variability characteristics for the life strategy of the spirochete  Borrelia burgdorferi  sensu lato, a complicated immune response, and imperfections in diagnostic methods. The study aimed to check the reactivity of sera from 69 patients with confirmed infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and BK virus (BKV) with  Borrelia  antigens used in serological tests: indirect immunofluorescence (IIFT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) and immunoblot (IB). In the group of patients infected with EBV, the highest percentage of positive/borderline anti- Borrelia  IgM and IgG results was obtained in the following tests: IIFT (51.9% for IgM, 63.0% for IgG), ELISA (22.2% for IgM, 29.6% for IgG) and IB (11.1% for IgM, 7.4% for IgG). In the group of CMV-infected patients, the highest percentage of positive/borderline anti- Borrelia  IgM results were obtained in the following tests: IB (23.1%), IIFT (15.4%) and ELISA (7.7%), while in the IgG class in the IIFT (15.4%), IB (11.5%) and ELISA (3.9%) tests. In the group of patients infected with BKV, the highest percentage of positive/borderline anti- Borrelia  IgM results was obtained in the following tests: IIFT (25.0%), IB (25.0%) and ELISA (3.9%), and in the IgG class in the tests: IB (50.0%), IIFT (6.2%) and ELISA (6.2%). The native flagellin (p41) and OspC proteins were the most frequently detected  Borrelia  antigens in all studied groups of patients in both classes of antibodies. Similar to other authors, the study confirmed the fact that serological tests used in the diagnosis of LD have a high potential to generate false positive results in patients with active viral infections, which may be related to cross-reacting antibodies appearing during the most common polyclonal activation of T/B lymphocytes, activated by viral superantigens.",

I was living with her at the time and never found anything out of the ordinary. She told me she was finding little black/white specks that she thought were bugs. Every time I looked at them, to me, they looked like regular dirt, dead skin, pieces of leaves tracked in from outside, with the occasional gnat mixed in. This upset her a lot and she couldn\u2019t ignore it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward a couple years and it\u2019s really been taking over her life. She now feels like a lot of the specks are coming from her (arms, legs especially.) She saves some of them to show me. She also thinks it\u2019s producing these tiny threads from her skin, not just various specks. She complains of itchiness and skin irritation in random spots. She\u2019s called multiple exterminators, treated the house, bought a thousand types of oils to use on her skin and on household objects. She\u2019s sprinkled diatomaceous earth around the house and removed a lot of towels and rugs because she believes whatever bug has infected her would thrive on them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe\u2019s had a few appointments with a dermatologist or two and they don\u2019t seem to agree with her assumptions. She\u2019s embarrassed, but she\u2019s also resistant to the idea that this might be psychological. It upsets her. I was hoping her situation would improve over time, but it\u2019s continued. She made one trip to the ER 6-12 months ago, but after a few recent sleepless nights, she messaged me saying she might go again. It\u2019s really affecting her quality of life. Let me say that aside from this, she\u2019s completely mentally solid and exhibits no other psychological issues. She\u2019s not frantic when discussing this, either. But she does get emotional and upset, sometimes crying when discussing how bad it\u2019s been for her, or if I act like I doubt her. It's really eating away at her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\u2019ve recommended everything within my common sense, knowledge, and power to Google, but it\u2019s beyond me. Frankly, I have no idea how to proceed, partly because I'm afraid to make it worse. I can\u2019t say for sure that it\u2019s not a real skin problem, but I see no evidence that it is. It\u2019s causing very real problems for her, and the idea that this could get any worse or degrade her mental health is terrifying to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would *greatly* appreciate any and all insight or recommendations on how to help her with this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks so much.",
    "document": "Morgellons disease: a filamentous borrelial dermatitis\nMorgellons disease (MD) is a dermopathy characterized by multicolored filaments that lie under, are embedded in, or project from skin. Although MD was initially considered to be a delusional disorder, recent studies have demonstrated that the dermopathy is associated with tickborne infection, that the filaments are composed of keratin and collagen, and that they result from proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in epithelial tissue. Culture, histopathological and molecular evidence of spirochetal infection associated with MD has been presented in several published studies using a variety of techniques. Spirochetes genetically identified as  Borrelia burgdorferi  sensu stricto predominate as the infective agent in most of the Morgellons skin specimens studied so far. Other species of  Borrelia  including  Borrelia garinii ,  Borrelia miyamotoi , and  Borrelia hermsii  have also been detected in skin specimens taken from MD patients.

    "question": "I really hope I can post this here. \n\nI don't even know where to start with all of this. I've been going through my personal hell as my body has been falling apart for over 6 months now. It's has been a long time since the beginning when this all started but I'm going to try to share as much information as I can remember in hopes that someone can give me any suggestions. \n\nSo about 6 months ago I was laying in bed thinking about the progress I had made recently on my depression and anxiety. I turned 18 earlier that year and I was finally able to move out with my girlfriend and things started turning around for the first time in my life. This is important because I was still lethargic all of the time and extremely thin even though I ate and had active job (Dairy Queen). Going back to that night I was trying to figure out what the source was of all of that and I assumed that it was something mental. Earlier that year I started to get into meditation so that I could \"feel\" all of the good and bad in my life. So as I lay there thinking I noticed that there was a large feeling of discomfort in my neck region. I touched my hand to my neck and felt what I can only describe as a \"tight wire\" deep inside my neck. It didnt feel like a muscle to me because of how thin and unflexable it was. Regardless I decided to try to \"stretch it out\" by turning my head to my left shoulder and then rotating my shin upwards slowly while in that position. In an instant I felt something \"yank\" upwards in my middle/upper back in between my spine and my shoulder blade. Immediately I was screaming bloody murder as it was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life.\n\nThat night I felt most of the pain in the entire right side of my face, neck, and shoulder blade area. All of the muscles in my back on the right side started swelling and spasming. I ended up going to the hospital that night but before I left my girlfriend saw that my right shoulder blade was \"out of place\" being way to close to my rib cage and as she gently pushed it back I felt a wave of relief (or pleasure?) before it would start moving out of place again. That night at the hospital they said there was nothing they could do for me and they just said nothing was broken and that I needed an MRI and to see my PCP because it could be serious. \nThe following 1-2 weeks I was resting in bed while still in extreme pain when I wasn't at work and when I was I kept it in the sling the ER had given me. After those weeks passed I laid down on my shoulder blade wrong and immediately the muscle spasms and swelling came back and the back side of my shoulder swelled like a balloon. This time not only did I feel the extremely tight wire in my neck but one going down into my arm too. The one in my arm went from somewhere on top of my shoulder blade all the way to my wrist. The tension was so bad that night that it felt like there was a mini skeleton that wrapped around all of the muscle in my arm. Not the muscles themselves but the hard things that separate them. I tried to bear the pain the best I could and then I at some point I felt something slide off of the bottom of my shoulder blade, and during my 3rd flair up a couple weeks later I felt another \"wire\" slide all the way up my shoulder blade when I lifted my arm. Each time I lifted it the wire moved about a centimeter upwards until it was all the way at the top \"wrapping around\" the neck wire that starts at the top pointy part of my scapula and goes into my neck leading up to the back of my head.\n\nSome notes other things that happened in between then and now is; I've felt something \"shift\" in my neck area 2-3 times, I've felt extreme pain behind my right eyeball during the 3 flair ups, I feel a wire going down into my leg as well and one that wraps around the right side of my groin, the wire that slipped off of my shoulder blade has been slipping back on every month of so for a couple weeks causing even worse pain until it slips off again, I usually only feel one of the wires painfully tight at any given time, there are \"perma-locked\" hard muscles in between the right side of my spine and shoulder blade starting at the base of my neck and ending before lower back, there is one muscles that bulges more than the others and when it's pressed on I feel all 3 wires lightly contract at the same time, I've lost more than 10% of my body weight in 3 months (95lbs and 5'7\"), entire abdomin is extremely tender especially the right side sending waves of pain throughout body when aggitated, pain at night can get to points where I black out and wake up the next morning.\n \nI got an MRI on my neck first and it came back saying nothing was wrong and I had to switch PCPs because this one thought I was just trying to get pain medication. More recently I got an MRI on my shoulder and that supposedly was fine as well. I have seen an orthopedic surgeon as well as a neurologist with both telling them they didn't think it was that kind of problem but I have a feeling one if not both of them missed something. This pain had never gone away since the day it started and it's better in the mornings until I move around too much. \n\nMy treatment right now is consisting of a heating pad, and kratom for the pain during the day, as well as two glasses of wine a night so that the pain is manageable enough to fall asleep. The orthopedic doctor I saw said he didn't know what it was but prescribed me 5mg Norco which did absolutely nothing for the pain in contrast to the kratom and alcohol. I didn't want a higher strength opiod in case I end up getting surgery so I discontinued the medication. I can't touch almost any of the right side of my body without being in extreme pain even with the kratom so I had to go on leave at my job 4 months ago. I apologise for the extremely long story but even with all of this I'm still simplifying everything that has happened to my body this past half year. I really hope somebody can have a dialogue with me about what could possibly be wrong and what specialist I need to visit or revisit. Thank you for reading if you made it this far and please ask me any and all questions and I will answer to the best of my ability. My body is getting weaker and I'm scared because I'm running out of time, insurance, and money and I know I can't keep living like this in debilitating pain at 19 years old without knowing what's happening. \n\nTLDR - severe constant pain resulting after something yanked in my back, has not improved at all over 6 months and my body is getting weaker as time goes by, feeling of a tight wire in my neck, arm, and leg with them all meeting at one hard muscle in my back. It feels like it started because one wire was twisted around another one and I stretched it wrong. Have seen orthopedic and neurologist so far as well as a comprehensive blood test.",

    "document": "Management of Chronic Paronychia\nChronic paronychia is an inflammatory disorder of the nail folds of a toe or finger presenting as redness, tenderness, and swelling. It is recalcitrant dermatoses seen commonly in housewives and housemaids. It is a multifactorial inflammatory reaction of the proximal nail fold to irritants and allergens. Repeated bouts of inflammation lead to fibrosis of proximal nail fold with poor generation of cuticle, which in turn exposes the nail further to irritants and allergens. Thus, general preventive measures form cornerstone of the therapy. Though previously anti-fungals were the mainstay of therapy, topical steroid creams have been found to be more effective in the treatment of chronic paronychia. In recalcitrant cases, surgical treatment may be resorted to, which includes en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold or an eponychial marsupialization, with or without nail plate removal. Newer therapies and surgical modalities are being employed in the management of chronic paronychia. In this overview, we review recent epidemiological studies, present current thinking on the pathophysiology leading to chronic paronychia, discuss the challenges chronic paronychia presents, and recommend a commonsense approach to management.",
    "response": "You choose to include no photographs, so everything I state here is speculative. Acute paronychia is almost always bacterial, and clears quickly with antibacterial treatment. Chronic paronychia is almost always inflammatory, and antifungal agents have no role. There are rare occurrences of yeast causing this, but this is obvious clinically and easy to distinguish. Butenafine is an excellent antifungal agent for tine infections, and as effective as any known topical agent. The reason for the statement about nails in the package insert is that for the most part topical agents do not effectively treat nail fungus infections. Efinaconazole is an exception and works better than any other topical agent."

    "document": "Exposure to Neighborhood Green Space and Mental Health: Evidence from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin \nGreen space is now widely viewed as a health-promoting characteristic of residential environments, and has been linked to mental health benefits such as recovery from mental fatigue and reduced stress, particularly through experimental work in environmental psychology. Few population level studies have examined the relationships between green space and mental health. Further, few studies have considered the role of green space in non-urban settings. This study contributes a population-level perspective from the United States to examine the relationship between environmental green space and mental health outcomes in a study area that includes a spectrum of urban to rural environments. Multivariate survey regression analyses examine the association between green space and mental health using the unique, population-based Survey of the Health of Wisconsin database. Analyses were adjusted for length of residence in the neighborhood to reduce the impact of neighborhood selection bias. Higher levels of neighborhood green space were associated with significantly lower levels of symptomology for depression, anxiety and stress, after controlling for a wide range of confounding factors.

We're just a normal family. He's bright and well-adjusted, and gets hugs 100 times a day. No visible causes or signs of anxiety. The pain is really bad, though. He is in utter despair and has talked a few times about just stabbing himself and ending it all. Edit: I should add that he has a lot of nausea, and often says that he feels \"odd\" or fears that he's going to die from the pain.\n\nHe had an esophagogastroduodenoscopy done last week and his stomach and duodenum are fine; the pain is around his navel area.\n\nWe've tried to eliminate all kinds of food, but there's no change.\n\nI'll be really happy for just any suggestion or idea.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all the comments so far!

    "document": "Pediatric abdominal migraine: current perspectives on a lesser known entity\nBackground \n             Abdominal migraine (AM) is a common cause of chronic and recurrent abdominal pain in children. It is characterized by paroxysms of moderate to severe abdominal pain that is midline, periumbilical, or diffuse in location and accompanied by other symptoms including headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, or pallor. Despite the presence of comprehensive diagnostic criteria under Rome IV classification of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and International Classification of Headache Disorders, it continues to be an underdiagnosed entity. \n           \n           \n             Overview \n             The average age of diagnosis is 3\u201310 years with peak incidence at 7 years. Most of the patients have a personal or family history of migraine. Pathophysiology of the condition is believed to be similar to that of other FGIDs and cephalic migraine. It is also well recognized as a type of pediatric migraine variant. A careful history, thorough physical examination, and use of well-defined, symptom-based guidelines are needed to make a diagnosis. Selective or no testing is required to support a positive diagnosis. It resolves completely in most of the patients. However, these patients have a strong propensity to develop migraine later in life. Explanation and reassurance should be the first step once the diagnosis is made. Nonpharmacologic treatment options including avoidance of triggers, behavior therapy, and dietary modifications should be the initial line of management. Drug therapy should be considered only if symptoms are refractory to these primary interventions. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             More research focused on pathophysiology and management of AM needs to be carried out to improve outcomes in affected children.",

While pathological innate immune activation is well documented in severe disease 1 , the impact of autoantibodies on disease progression is less defined. Here, we used a high-throughput autoantibody discovery technique called Rapid Extracellular Antigen Profiling (REAP) to screen a cohort of 194 SARS-CoV-2 infected COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers for autoantibodies against 2,770 extracellular and secreted proteins (the \u201cexoproteome\u201d). We found that COVID-19 patients exhibit dramatic increases in autoantibody reactivities compared to uninfected controls, with a high prevalence of autoantibodies against immunomodulatory proteins including cytokines, chemokines, complement components, and cell surface proteins. We established that these autoantibodies perturb immune function and impair virological control by inhibiting immunoreceptor signaling and by altering peripheral immune cell composition, and found that murine surrogates of these autoantibodies exacerbate disease severity in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of autoantibodies against tissue-associated antigens revealed associations with specific clinical characteristics and disease severity. In summary, these findings implicate a pathological role for exoproteome-directed autoantibodies in COVID-19 with diverse impacts on immune functionality and associations with clinical outcomes.",

However, some individuals reportedly remain SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive by pharyngeal swabs weeks after recovery. Whether viral RNA in these persistent carriers is contagious and stimulates SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses is unknown. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             This cohort study was conducted between April 3 rd \u2013July 9 th  2020, recruiting COVID-19 recovered individuals that were symptom-free for at least 14 days. We collected serum for SARS-CoV-2-specific total Ig, IgA and IgM detection by ELISA, pharyngeal swabs (two time points) for ddPCR and PBMCs for anti-SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T-cell dextramer analyses. \n           \n           \n             Findings \n             We enrolled 203 post-symptomatic participants with a previous RT-PCR-verified SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    "document": "Interactive Effects of Dopamine Baseline Levels and Cycle Phase on Executive Functions: The Role of Progesterone\nEstradiol and progesterone levels vary along the menstrual cycle and have multiple neuroactive effects, including on the dopaminergic system. Dopamine relates to executive functions in an \u201cinverted U-shaped\u201d manner and its levels are increased by estradiol. Accordingly, dopamine dependent changes in executive functions along the menstrual cycle have been previously studied in the pre-ovulatory phase, when estradiol levels peak. Specifically it has been demonstrated that working memory is enhanced during the pre-ovulatory phase in women with low dopamine baseline levels, but impaired in women with high dopamine baseline levels. However, the role of progesterone, which peaks in the luteal cycle phase, has not been taken into account previously. Therefore, the main goals of the present study were to extend these findings (i) to the luteal cycle phase and (ii) to other executive functions. Furthermore, the usefulness of the eye blink rate (EBR) as an indicator of dopamine baseline levels in menstrual cycle research was explored. 36 naturally cycling women were tested during three cycle phases (menses\u2013low sex hormones; pre-ovulatory\u2013high estradiol; luteal\u2013high progesterone and estradiol). During each session, women performed a verbal N-back task, as measure of working memory, and a single trial version of the Stroop task, as measure of response inhibition and cognitive flexibility. Hormone levels were assessed from saliva samples and spontaneous eye blink rate was recorded during menses. In the N-back task, women were faster during the luteal phase the higher their progesterone levels, irrespective of their dopamine baseline levels. In the Stroop task, we found a dopamine-cycle interaction, which was also driven by the luteal phase and progesterone levels. For women with higher EBR performance decreased during the luteal phase, whereas for women with lower EBR performance improved during the luteal phase. These findings suggest an important role of progesterone in modulating dopamine-cycle interactions. Additionally, we identified the eye blink rate as a non-invasive indicator of baseline dopamine function in menstrual cycle research.",

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequent type of skin cancer in humans. Surgical excision is still considered the \u201cgold-standard\u201d of treatment. However, a number of topical therapies are now available for the treatment of different types of basal cell carcinoma. \n           \n           \n             Case Report \n             This case report exemplifies the usefulness of dermoscopy in the monitoring of residual disease after incomplete surgical excision and also in the monitoring of topical treatment response. Imiquimod 5% cream acts as a topical immune response modifier promoting a Th-1 immune response enhancing the removal of neoplastic cells and has proven to reduce deregulated Hedgehog (HH)/GLI signal strength independent of Toll-like receptor signaling, which makes it a valuable adjuvant topical therapy for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Imiquimod 5% cream is a valuable adjuvant therapy for the treatment of incompletely excised BCC. This case report adds further evidence to the usefulness of dermoscopy in the assessment and monitoring of treatment outcome. \n           \n           \n             Electronic supplementary material \n             The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s13555-015-0088-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

    "question": "Male\n31\n5ft 2\nTeacher\nNot a diagnose me post. I\u2019ve seen a fair few medics and nurses in my time and what has always intrigued me has been the sheer numbers of religious practitioners. In a field obsessed with objectivity and data, what is it that veers people towards religion? Medicine is a tough and traumatic career at times; is it escapism to balance things? What is it?",
    "document": "Religious Characteristics of U.S. Physicians\nBACKGROUND \n             Patients' religious commitments and religious communities are known to influence their experiences of illness and their medical decisions. Physicians are also dynamic partners in the doctor\u2013patient relationship, yet little is known about the religious characteristics of physicians or how physicians' religious commitments shape the clinical encounter. \n           \n           \n             OBJECTIVE \n             To provide a baseline description of physicians' religious characteristics, and to compare physicians' characteristics with those of the general U.S. population. \n           \n           \n             DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS \n             Mailed survey of a stratified random sample of 2,000 practicing U.S. physicians. Comparable U.S. population data are derived from the 1998 General Social Survey. \n           \n           \n             MEASUREMENTS/RESULTS \n             The response rate was 63%. Fifty-five percent of physicians say their religious beliefs influence their practice of medicine. Compared with the general population, physicians are more likely to be affiliated with religions that are underrepresented in the United States, less likely to say they try to carry their religious beliefs over into all other dealings in life (58% vs 73%), twice as likely to consider themselves spiritual but not religious (20% vs 9%), and twice as likely to cope with major problems in life without relying on God (61% vs 29%). \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSIONS \n             Physicians' religious characteristics are diverse and they differ in many ways from those of the general population. Researchers, medical educators, and policy makers should further examine the ways in which physicians' religious commitments shape their clinical engagements.",
    "response": "It's an interesting question.  I initially wanted to attribute the answer to regional variation.  I used to practice in a liberal area, and almost nobody I worked with (docs nor nurses) practiced any religion.  Now I'm in a more conservative area and far more people have a religious affiliation.\n\nLooking at the data, physicians may actually be more religious than the general population:\n\n[\n\nOther studies show a higher rate of agnosticism among physicians:\n\n[\n\nIt gets more complicated when you factor in age, race, education level, income level, medical specialty, etc.\n\nI think if you have seen a substantial number of nurses and physicians who are religious, you are likely seeing too small of a sample size.  Perhaps it is regional variation, perhaps it is related to other demographics.  Overall I think the physicians probably represent somewhere close to the general demographics for religious affiliation."

    "question": "I have a request to the medical community, in particular an Emergency Room Doctor.\n\nThree years ago today, my wife died. \n\nWhen we found her, she was unresponsive. This was early morning after a long and strenuous talk between she and I. I made her breakfast, gave it to her daughter to bring up to mom. The daughter came back down and said Mom was acting weird. She was unresponsive. I gave her CPR while calling for the ambulance. The ambulance arrived, and they brought her to the hospital. She was pronounced dead there in front of me. \n\nEvery day, I try not to wonder about things, but this is the one day a year that I permit the thoughts to linger for more than a moment. Originally, I would have gone to the hospital to ask this, but given the current dumpster fire that the United States is in, I thought it not best to go up there.\n\nI was hoping to be able to talk with an ER Doctor about what happened. I have all of her files from that day, it's a stack of EKG readings, the notes from the 911 officer, the hospital, etc.. And I just have questions.\n\nMy wife suffered from Myotonic Dystrophy, and an undiagnosed long QT rhythm (I found out later it's a genetic trait that the family has that they didn't really know). She had Polycystic Overian Syndrome. She was 5'9, somewhere around 200lbs. She was probably malnourished, as she was on a diet trying to lose weight, and was very stressed from that week because of work, family, diet, and I was out of town.\n\nAnd, in case this isn't something you want to broach someone with, my questions aren't around procedure, or blaming any doctor or medical staff. They're just...morose pondering:\n\n1) Was she conscious when she died?\n\n2) Did she know she was dying?\n\n3) Could knowing anything about the long QT change anything?\n\nI hurt. My existence hurts. Our family hurts. And it's been three years, and this is really the only day I permit myself to get into this slump. And, it's probably going to hurt. It's probably going to suck to ask or talk about. But...I gotta know.\n\nSo if anyone is willing to hop on a call, and/or look at some paperwork, I'd be greatly appreciative of it.\n\n**Day after edit:** The question has been answered, so to those that I didn't get to reply before the thread was locked, I just want to say thank you.

    "response": "I am very sorry for your loss. It must still hurt so deeply, even three years later.\n\nI agree with my colleague that, knowing her medical history, it seems likely she died due to her Long QT syndrome. This is a problem with the hearts electrical system which, when triggered, causes a sudden abnormal heart rate, an arrhythmia which is very rapid. The heart cannot sustain blood flow to the brain and organs when this occurs. Most people who die from this become unconscious very quickly. She may have had a brief period where she felt lightheaded or felt heart palpitations, but it was unlikely to have been painful. She may have been aware that something was wrong, but she did not likely spend a long period knowing she was dying.\n\nIf she had known about the Long QT syndrome, she may have gotten an implanted defibrillator. Other family members should be tested for this to see if they need one, too. It sounds like some of them already have. It is also important to avoid certain medications when someone has a history of Long QT syndrome--many common medications including antibiotics, anti-nausea medications, and antidepressants can lengthen the QT and make someone more likely to have an abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nI am happy to take a look at the paperwork you have. I am not sure how much clarity it would give, but I can take a look."

    "question": "Posting again because I hope to get more responses.\n\nHey all. I\u2019m an 18 year-old male senior in high school  (155 lbs, 6\u20190\u201d) that has been dealing with a life-altering medical condition for what I presume to be most of my life.\n\nI\u2019m not sure exactly when it started, but the best way I thought I could  explain what I have endured and my journey through it would be starting with my symptoms. Every couple of seconds, I presume in conjunction with blood flow to my head, I get a sensation of \u201cblanking out\u201d almost like the entirety of my brain shuts down for a split second. If I were to look at an object for an extended period of time, every couple of seconds I would slightly lose focus of it and have to reorient myself to it,  which when applied in a broader sense makes everything from my perspective seem less grounded and real. I\u2019ve had people watch my eyes and tell me that they don\u2019t move, so I don\u2019t know exactly where this is coming from. Additionally, it\u2019s almost like I cant keep track of too much at the same time because I feel like I am constantly losing focus. This affliction has affected nearly every aspect of my life, from academics, socializing, and self-acceptance in ways that you can\u2019t imagine. It feels as if I am a fragmented version of my true self, which is just awful.\n\nI\u2019m an effort to resolve this issue, I\u2019ve tried nearly everything that I could think of. First I tried changing my diet. Nothing. Then my sleep and exercise habits. Nothing. Then ensuring I get every single possible vitamin or mineral that I could possibly be deficient in. Nothing. Then I went to a chiropractor for speculation that it could be an issue related to my neck. Nothing. My parents put me on anti depressants and ADD medications because as a result of my issue I exhibit some symptoms of ADD. They made me feel a little funky, but didn\u2019t fix or change the issue at all. I went to a psychiatrist who just dismissed what I had was all in my head, and a therapist who was helpful for other aspects of life but could not offer any advice for my affliction. I convinced my parents to let me go see another chiropractor that specialized in upper cervical adjustments, as that\u2019s what I thought could be the underlying key after all this time. After half a year of doing that, the best that it could  offer was inconsistent slight alleviation of my symptoms. From this I thought that maybe I could get at least some relief from self massage and muscle release of my upper neck and head area, so I attempted probably hundreds of different stretches and exercises from every corner of the web to release any possible muscle tension or tightness that could be leading to this. Nothing.\n\nThat is until about a week ago, when I noticed something peculiar when messing around with my tmj joint. If I open my jaw wide, go behind the joint right on the front of my left ear,  move up to where I feel two bones connect, and push in to try to separate them for about a minute, I get a moderate amount of temporary relief. When I do this, I also get a strange warm and liquidy sensation in that joint, as well as being able to feel the blood flow from some blood vessel connected there to the inside of my head near the left far end of my mouth. The relief only lasts around 15-45 minutes, and sometimes if I push too hard my cheeks feel worse and my mental state becomes even weirder, but for some reason out of every single thing that I\u2019ve tried this is the only maneuver that works consistently.\n\nThroughout the years I have gotten an MRI of my head, an MRA of my head, and an MRI of my cervical spine that have all supposedly come back normal, which makes no sense to me because my symptoms and sensations are reality.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if I could possibly have an issue with a subdued artery that runs near my tmj joint that could be doing weird things to blood flow to my brain, because honestly that\u2019s what it feels like is happening. The constant change and fluctuation in my mental status and capabilities has nearly driven me to the edge, and that coupled with what I know I could be capable of if I didn\u2019t have such an affliction makes me horribly depressed and dare I say slightly suicidal.\n\nI know this is quite a handful and seems outright crazy and confusing from an outside perspective, but I am going again to a doctor this week to describe in detail my symptoms and how I can partially remedy them, so any insight or advice from a doctor on here on what could possibly be the cause of this or what to bring up with her would be highly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for all your responses, I\u2019ll make sure to bring up a lot of the possibilities with my physician. Even though I still don\u2019t know the exact root cause it is incredibly relieving to know that other people are willing to offer their ideas and help after it feeling like me against the world for so long.",

    "question": "Hoping we can get some ideas as to what's wrong with our 1F daughter. We've seen her pediatrician and several specialists. Nothing has improved.\n\nThe problem became apparent when she was 4 weeks old. She developed belly pain, blood and mucous in her stool, diarrhea, thrashing/arching, screaming, rashy skin, eczema, hives, painful gas, and silent reflux. She is breastfed, and at 2 months old, her pediatrician recommended removing dairy from my wife\u2019s diet. This change led to enough improvement around the clock that we were able to start to detect patterns of reactions from other foods.\n\nBetween the ages of 2.5-4.5 months, through detailed food journaling, my wife also eliminated oats, peanuts, wheat, tree nuts (almonds/cashews), and coconut from her diet, all of which produced some combination of the symptoms noted above. \n\nSince initial diagnosis:\n\n* At 5 months old, skin prick allergy testing for all known triggers was negative, and the allergist diagnosed her with Food Protein Induced Allergic Proctocolitis (FPIAP), an illness related to the more severe FPIES.\n* At 5 months old, we introduced solids. Every. Single. Food. caused some combination of rashy skin, dark circles around her eye(s), diarrhea, screaming/thrashing in pain, perceived abdominal cramping, eczema outbreaks, painful gas, etc.\n   * Solids we tried and failed include: carrots, sweet potato, pear, broccoli, peanut butter.\n* At 6.5 months old, gastroenterologist #1 recommended Nutramigen and Pepcid, which we introduced separately, and both caused reactions. \n* GI #1 also recommended cutting soy from mom\u2019s diet, which we did. \n* At 7.5 months old, our immunologist thought it might be T-cell related, but thought it was a GI problem and didn\u2019t have a clear answer, so referred us to GI #2.\n* At 8 months old, GI #1 ordered labs: immunophenotyping, tryptase (to rule out MCAS), and CBC w/ differential. \n   * Results were mostly normal, except: minimally increased naive cytotoxic T cells, slightly elevated platelets, and slightly elevated neutrophils. \n   * GI #1 attributed these results to an acute infection like a cold. Problem is, the kid wasn\u2019t sick. She wasn\u2019t reacting either - she was totally at baseline at the time of the blood draw.\n* By this time, her pediatrician and all specialists agreed we needed to push through skin reactions and mild gas or discomfort to get her acclimated to eating something - anything. \n   * Conditions for stopping food trials would 1) profuse diarrhea, 2) blood in stool, 3) inconsolable pain.\n   * At 8 months old, we successfully introduced avocado and banana by pushing through minor symptoms.\n* At 8.5 months old, we introduced Puramino (elemental formula), and she had excessive diarrhea.\n* At 8.5 months old, GI #2 diagnosed her with FPIAP, and recommended reintroducing allergens into mom\u2019s diet, slowly, one at a time. \n* At 9 months old, mom reintroduced wheat, starting with 1/4 slice of bread per day. The first two days went well enough, so mom increased to 1/2 slice per day. Within 30 minutes after nursing, baby was covered in hives. (Remember - allergy testing was negative.) Mom dropped back down to 1/4 slice for another 4 days. Baby was increasingly fussy, uncomfortable, gassy, rashy, worsening eczema, and just\u2026 out of it. So after day 7, we stopped. The next day, baby was perfect - happy, bubbly, giggly, wonderful.\n\nOur symptoms of a failed introduction often begin with skin rashes within 1-3 hours after food consumption (sometimes a bit longer if via breastmilk), and other symptoms escalate over the course of the day, usually ending with the screaming/thrashing/cramping belly pain by the evening. The acute reaction which we see the same day as a fail usually resolve quickly (within 24 hours), but lingering symptoms like diarrhea, or blood/mucous in the stool can take up to two weeks to return to baseline.\n\nTo us, the diagnosis of FPIAP does not add up. Blood in the stool and mucousy/watery stool are classic FPIAP symptoms, sure. Most kids with FPIAP are sensitive to dairy and/or soy, typically react to no more than a couple of foods total, and outgrow their reactions between 9-12 months. Our daughter reacts to everything, even elemental formula and Pepcid, and her symptoms are more than just bloody poop.\n\nTL;DR What condition would cause allergy-like reactions to 13 foods plus formulas, AND have elevated T cells/platelets/neutrophils?",
    "document": "Acute FPIES reactions are associated with an IL-17 inflammatory signature\nBackground: \n             Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy characterized by profuse vomiting within hours of ingestion of the causative food. We have previously reported that FPIES is associated with systemic innate immune activation in the absence of a detectable antigen-specific antibody or T cell response. The mechanism of specific food recognition by the immune system remains unclear. \n           \n           \n             Objective: \n             To identify immune mechanisms underlying FPIES reactions by proteomic and flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood. \n           \n           \n             Methods: \n             Children with a history of FPIES underwent a supervised oral food challenge.

The mucosal damage marker REG1A was also significantly increased. These biomarkers were not increased in asymptomatic challenges or IgE-mediated allergy. Phospho-STAT3 was significantly elevated in myeloid and T cells post-challenge in individuals with symptoms.

This is a really tough pill to swallow for parents, because this false information is *everywhere* on the internet. Here is a patient-friendly article on the subject by the American Academy of Dermatology:\n\n[\n\nI know you've kept a food diary, and I know every child is different. But the best, most thoughtful medicine would be to consider the GI symptoms and the rashes as separate entities. For this reason, **scratch/skin testing is notoriously terrible for diagnosing food intolerances.** \n\nSecond, you will find no answers in your white blood cell differential. Your GI doctor was referencing an acute stress reaction, which is one reason to have elevated T-cells, platelets, neutrophils, and a whole host of so-called \"acute phase reactants.\" Another explanation is that it was a random sampling error, because that pattern on a blood count simply doesn't mean anything diagnostically valuable. It's such a benign pattern that even if you drew it again six months later and got the exact same results, you could chalk it up to that just is her \"normal,\" because, statistically, 5% of normal, healthy people will live outside the reference range for *every* lab value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour poor girl sounds absolutely miserable, and I'm very sorry if I come off as dismissive.

    "document": "Burning mouth syndrome\nIntroduction \n             Burning mouth syndrome mainly affects women, particularly after the menopause, when its prevalence may be 18% to 33%. \n           \n           \n             Methods and outcomes \n             We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for burning mouth syndrome? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to November 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). \n           \n           \n             Results \n             We found 15 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: anaesthetics (local), antidepressants, benzodiazepines (topical clonazepam), benzydamine hydrochloride, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), dietary supplements, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women. \n           \n        \n           Key Points \n           Burning mouth syndrome is characterised by discomfort or pain of the mouth, with no known medical or dental cause. It may affect up to one third of postmenopausal women and up to 15% of adults overall.\n Symptoms of burning mouth can also be caused by infections, allergies, vitamin deficiencies, and ill-fitting dentures, leading to problems identifying effective treatments. Psychogenic factors may be involved in some people, such as anxiety, depression, or personality disorders. People with burning mouth syndrome may show altered sensory and pain thresholds, or other signs of neuropathy. Complete spontaneous remission occurs in only a small percentage of people, and up to 30% will note moderate improvement with or without treatment. \n \n           CBT  may improve symptom intensity compared with placebo, although we found no good-quality studies. \n           Topical clonazepam  may reduce pain compared with placebo, but it may be absorbed systemically, with increased risk of dependence over time.\n We don't know whether  antidepressants ,  benzydamine hydrochloride , or  HRT  in postmenopausal women can improve symptoms of burning mouth, as we found few studies. Dietary supplements  may be no more effective than placebo at reducing symptoms of burning mouth.",

Its aetiology and pathogenesis are obscure, but both psychogenic factors and peripheral and central neuropathies appear to be implicated. There is no cure for BMS, and treatment with either local or systemic medications focuses on the relief of symptoms and on improving quality of life. In recalcitrant cases, psychological/psychiatric intervention may be helpful. In order to improve treatment outcomes, a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this syndrome might provide a basis for the development of more effective management strategies. In this short review, we discuss current knowledge of the diagnosis, aetiopathogenesis, and management of BMS.",

    "document": "Burning mouth syndrome: Current concepts\nBurning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic pain condition. It has been described by the International Headache Society as \u201can intra-oral burning or dysesthetic sensation, recurring daily for more than 2 h/day for more than 3 months, without clinically evident causative lesions.\u201d BMS is frequently seen in women in the peri-menopausal and menopausal age group in an average female/male ratio of 7:1. The site most commonly affected is the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The patient may also report taste alterations and oral dryness along with the burning. The etiopathogenesis is complex and is not well-comprehended. The more accepted theories point toward a neuropathic etiology, but the gustatory system has also been implicated in this condition. BMS is frequently mismanaged, partly because it is not well-known among healthcare providers. Diagnosis of BMS is made after other local and systemic causes of burning have been ruled out as then; the oral burning is the disease itself. The management of BMS still remains a challenge. Benzodiazepines have been used in clinical practice as the first-line medication in the pharmacological management of BMS. Nonpharmacological management includes cognitive behavioral therapy and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). The aim of this review is to familiarize healthcare providers with the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and general characteristics of primary BMS while updating them with the current treatment options to better manage this group of patients.",

Occasionally I experience this itch on my left hand but not to the same extreme (I am right handed btw). The itch feels like it\u2019s deep inside my skin and the only way to get any relief is to press hard with my nails or teeth but it always comes back. It often times even feels more like a stabbing pain than an itch. Day by day the level of pain that I\u2019m feeling changes and throughout the day I\u2019ll get moments where I don\u2019t feel anything and others where I have painful flare ups. I don\u2019t have any known allergies nor have I been interacting with different foods or metals than I usually do so I\u2019m at a loss as to what could be causing this. I also have seen no rash, blisters, or even redness related to the itch, only a minimal amount of peeling skin that I believe has more to do with how hard I have to scratch.

It presents as a painful vesicular eruption, forming unsightly crusts, which cause cosmetic disfigurement and psychosocial distress. There is no cure available, and it recurs periodically. \n           \n           \n             Objectives \n             To assess the effects of interventions for the prevention of HSL in people of all ages. \n           \n           \n             Search methods \n             We searched the following databases up to 19 May 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Oral Health Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Airiti Library, and 5 trial registers. To identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials, we scanned the bibliographies of included studies and published reviews, and we also contacted the original researchers of our included studies. \n           \n           \n             Selection criteria \n             Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for preventing HSL in immunocompetent people. \n           \n           \n             Data collection and analysis \n             Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third author was available for resolving differences of opinion. \n           \n           \n             Main results \n             This review included 32 RCTs, with a total of 2640 immunocompetent participants, covering 19 treatments. The quality of the body of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, but was very low for a few outcomes. Our primary outcomes were 'Incidence of HSL' and 'Adverse effects during use of the preventative intervention'. \n             The evidence for short\u2010term (\u2264 1 month) use of oral aciclovir in preventing recurrent HSL was inconsistent across the doses used in the studies: 2 RCTs showed low quality evidence for a reduced recurrence of HSL with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.51; n = 177), while 1 RCT testing aciclovir 800 mg twice daily and 2 RCTs testing 200 mg 5 times daily found no similar preventive effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.87; n = 237; moderate quality evidence and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.07; n = 66; low quality evidence, respectively). The direction of intervention effect was unrelated to the risk of bias. The evidence from 1 RCT for the effect of short\u2010term use of valaciclovir in reducing recurrence of HSL by clinical evaluation was uncertain (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.28; n = 125; moderate quality evidence), as was the evidence from 1 RCT testing short\u2010term use of famciclovir. \n             Long\u2010term (> 1 month) use of oral antiviral agents reduced the recurrence of HSL. There was low quality evidence from 1 RCT that long\u2010term use of oral aciclovir reduced clinical recurrences (1.80 versus 0.85 episodes per participant per a 4\u2010month period, P = 0.009) and virological recurrence (1.40 versus 0.40 episodes per participant per a 4\u2010month period, P = 0.003). One RCT found long\u2010term use of valaciclovir effective in reducing the incidence of HSL (with a decrease of 0.09 episodes per participant per month; n = 95). One RCT found that a long\u2010term suppressive regimen of valaciclovir had a lower incidence of HSL than an episodic regimen of valciclovir (difference in means (MD) \u20100.10 episodes per participant per month, 95% CI \u20100.16 to \u20100.05; n = 120). \n             These trials found no increase in adverse events associated with the use of oral antiviral agents (moderate quality evidence). \n             There was no evidence to show that short\u2010term use of topical antiviral agents prevented recurrent HSL. There was moderate quality evidence from 2 RCTs that topical aciclovir 5% cream probably has little effect on preventing recurrence of HSL (pooled RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.72; n = 271). There was moderate quality evidence from a single RCT that topical foscarnet 3% cream has little effect in preventing HSL (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.40; n = 295). \n             The efficacy of long\u2010term use of topical aciclovir cream was uncertain. One RCT found significantly fewer research\u2010diagnosed recurrences of HSL when on aciclovir cream treatment than on placebo (P < 0.05), but found no significant differences in the mean number of participant\u2010reported recurrences between the 2 groups (P \u2265 0.05). One RCT found no preventive effect of topical application of 1,5\u2010pentanediol gel for 26 weeks (P > 0.05). Another RCT found that the group who used 2\u2010hydroxypropyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclo dextrin 20% gel for 6 months had significantly more recurrences than the placebo group (P = 0.003). \n             These studies found no increase in adverse events related to the use of topical antiviral agents. \n             Two RCTs found that the application of sunscreen significantly prevented recurrent HSL induced by experimental ultraviolet light (pooled RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.33; n = 111), but another RCT found that sunscreen did not prevent HSL induced by sunlight (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.06; n = 51). These RCTs did not report adverse events. \n             There were very few data suggesting that thymopentin, low\u2010level laser therapy, and hypnotherapy are effective in preventing recurrent HSL, with one to two RCTs for each intervention. We failed to find any evidence of efficacy for lysine, LongoVital\u00ae supplementation, gamma globulin, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I subunit vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine in preventing HSL. There were no consistent data supporting the efficacy of levamisole and interferon, which were also associated with an increased risk of adverse effects such as fever. \n           \n           \n             Authors' conclusions \n             The current evidence demonstrates that long\u2010term use of oral antiviral agents can prevent HSL, but the clinical benefit is small. We did not find evidence of an increased risk of adverse events. On the other hand, the evidence on topical antiviral agents and other interventions either showed no efficacy or could not confirm their efficacy in preventing HSL. \n           \n        \n           Plain language summary \n           \n             Measures for preventing cold sores \n           \n           \n             Review question \n           \n           What measures are effective in preventing recurrence of cold sores? \n           \n             Background \n           \n           A cold sore is an irritating recurrent viral infection with no proven cure. It gives rise to painful vesicles on the lips that form unsightly crusts, causing an unpleasant look and mental distress. We aimed to examine the effects of available measures for preventing recurrence of cold sores in people with normal immunity. \n           \n             Study characteristics \n           \n           We examined the research published up to 19 May 2015. We wanted to include studies only if receiving one preventative measure or another was decided by chance. This research method, termed randomised controlled trial (RCT), is the best way to test that a preventive effect is caused by the measure being tested. We found 32 RCTs that included 2640 people and examined 19 preventative measures. The drug manufacturer funded a total of 18 out of 32 studies, non\u2010profit organisations funded 4, and we do not know how the other 10 were funded. \n           \n             Key results \n           \n           Long\u2010term use of antiviral drugs taken by mouth prevented cold sores, though with a very small decrease of 0.09 episodes per person per month .  The preventative effect of long\u2010term use of aciclovir cream applied to the lips was uncertain. Long\u2010term use of 1,5\u2010pentanediol gel and 2\u2010hydroxypropyl\u2010\u03b2\u2010cyclo dextrin 20% gel applied to the lips did not prevent cold sores. \n           Short\u2010term use of either antiviral drugs or creams did not prevent cold sores. Neither short\u2010term nor long\u2010term use of these antiviral drugs or creams appeared to cause side\u2010effects. \n           The preventative effects of sunscreen were uncertain. Application of sunscreen prevented cold sores induced by experimental ultraviolet light, but did not prevent cold sores induced by sunlight. \n           We found very little evidence about the preventative effects of thymopentin, low\u2010energy laser, and hypnotherapy for cold sores. The available evidence found no preventative effects of lysine, LongoVital\u00ae supplementation, gamma globulin, herpes virus vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine. There were no consistent data to confirm that levamisole and interferon do prevent cold sores. \n           These studies found no increase in adverse events related to the use of topical antiviral agents. \n           \n             Quality of the evidence \n           \n           The quality of the evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, but was very low for some outcomes.",

    "question": "Hi,\n\n24 y/o white female-5'7\" 200 lb. I'm not looking for any definitive answers I guess just a direction to go in. When I was 14, I had sudden stomach pains, went to the ER, and it turned out I had a football size cyst wrapped around my ovary. They did not know the cyst was that big going into the surgery, but all of it plus my ovary were removed. My physical recovery had no complications, however, when I woke up from the surgery I felt completely different and this has not gone away since.\n\nTo be more specific, I woke up and immediately felt sad, numb, depressed, and colors were dull. Additionally, I had a really hard time following directions and focusing on what was happening or what people were telling me. I didn't understand what my nurse was telling me to do and everyone had to keep repeating things to me. I thought, \"hey, you literally just had surgery, so it'll go away with time\"\n\nBefore this surgery, I enjoyed normal 14 year old things like watching TV and movies, spending time with friends, and reading. After the surgery, I struggled to do these things. Reading became impossible, watching movies became very difficult, and I would have a hard time getting through a few minutes of TV. I couldn't keep up in conversations with friends and just overall could not focus on ANYTHING and this has NEVER changed. I struggled in school for the first time in my life and would forget easy words, how to spell easy words, and my quality of writing just went way downhill. It has been 10 years and these things are still the same. If I try to focus on anything, I get almost like an internal pain that tells me to stop.\n\nIt was also at this time, I became exhausted constantly. I slept for 4+ hours after school, which was very unlike me. I was put on armodafinil (stimulant-like drug) after having a daytime sleep study and things got slightly better, but the cognitive side effects were still there. I also struggled with diarrhea and IBS symptoms constantly, which I had not prior to the surgery. I became suddenly severely lactose intolerant. I went to dozens of specialists who said it was just depression or anxiety (which I had no history of prior) or would run tests and everything came out fine (thyroid, blood sugar, etc). I eventually went to a rheumatologist who diagnosed me with hypermobile joints and recommended a cardiologist, as it could be POTS, which is often associated with hypermobile joints. \n\nThe cardiologist gave me fludrocortisone, to increase my blood pressure when standing, which I admit did help somewhat. I increased fluid and salt intake as well. Things started to look up and at this point, I was about to graduate from high school and was able to go to college. I was on fludrocortisone for a year, gained 70 pounds on it (not fun, but worth it I guess) and went to college right after stopping it. I started being able to exercise and walked to my classes about 5 miles a day. I still struggled hardcore with focusing and the weird depression was still there, but things were somewhat better.\n\nHowever, things started to slowly, very slowly, turn bad again over the next 3-4 years. My second year of college, I fell into a deeper depression for seemingly no reason and the cognitive side effects were bad again. I sought psychiatric help and therapy. I have been on over 10 different psychiatric drugs over the past few years and I have not felt symptom alleviation. I was able to make it through college and then grad school right after, but at the end of grad school (also when I was put on lithium for the first time) I started feeling much much sicker and barely scraped by. I started struggling to move. I would sit in the same position for so long because any small movement is exhausting. If I need to take a shower, I cry because it is so exhausting and it hurts. i went off of lithium after a few months, but this is still happening and it has been happening for over a year. I also have significantly drier hair and my cognition is shot. I can't follow simple directions anymore and can't respond to friends' text messages easily. I had to quit my job, which I was barely making it as it is. Anything involving planning or executive functioning skills I just cannot do. I cannot plan ahead easily and have not been able to since the surgery. Also, I started having constipation around this time and my lactose intolerance went away?\n\nI had regular blood tests done a few weeks ago after going to the ER the fatigue was so bad. Everything turned out fine including my thyroid. I am currently only on 200mg of armodafinil and 900mg of trileptal for mood. I do not believe this is just depression. I have had longstanding cognitive effects that have declined slowly, even when periods of my mood being better, they have never gone away. I've never had weakness like this before either and am terrified.\n\nIf you've read through all of this, thank you.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to include that my sex drive, although I was only 14, has almost disappeared after the surgery as well.\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you all so much. I didn't expect anyone to care and I am literally sobbing right now. This has affected every aspect of my life for so long and it's been extremely rough. Y'all have made me validated. Thank you <3",

Graft failure and death of the donor\u2019s recipient were examined as time-varying exposures. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             After start of insurance benefits, the cumulative frequency of depression diagnosis was 4.2% at one-year and 11.5% at five years, and was less common than among age-and-gender matched general insurance beneficiaries (rate ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.60\u20130.81). Demographic and clinical correlates of increased likelihood of depression diagnoses among the prior donors included female gender, white race and some perioperative complications. After adjustment for donor demographic factors, recipient death (aHR 2.23, 95% CI 1.11\u20134.48) and death-censored graft failure (aHR 3.30, 95% CI 1.49\u20137.34) were associated with two-to-three times the relative risk of subsequent depression diagnosis among non-spousal unrelated donors. There were trends towards increased depression diagnoses after recipient death and graft failure among spousal donors, but no evidence of associations of these recipient events with the likelihood of depression diagnosis among related donors. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Recipient death and graft loss predict increased depression risk among unrelated living donors in this privately-insured sample. Informed consent and post-donation care should consider the potential impact of recipient outcomes on the psychological health of the donor.",

    "response": "From a quick look at that article, I'm not a fan. They don't have a control group or a placebo, so there's no way to compare patients, except against their own baseline. They gave all the patients the folate, so there's no way to see whether patients just reported feeling better because they thought they should feel better taking an extra medication.

    "question": "9 months ago, as part of treatment for a 60mph rear end I was in over 2 years ago now, I visited a chiropractor with 20 years in the business.  I visited him twice for mid thoracic & shoulder pain, no neck pain to speak of -- first visit went fine, but on the second visit when he adjusted my neck, it went wildly wrong.  He didn't take any time at all to prepare me for the adjustment, and my body involuntarily flinched and resisted with full force to the right.  The chiropractor was ignorant and forced my head against my resistance a full 90 degrees to the left.  No popping happened, but he sure was trying for it.  I felt a lot of torque and muscle tension -- it was very disconcerting, but no immediate pain.  I didn't think much of it at first given no pain, but it was enough to scare me out of going again.  In the following days & weeks, I started getting electric shock symptoms at the left base of my neck when reaching far with my left arm (out, up, down), or moving my neck in a certain way.  Got an EMG 3 weeks later that stated moderate chronic radiculopathy of C8 on the left.  I proceeded to go through 12+ weeks of PT, Traction, Airrosti, tried dry needling etc.  No improvement.  I even faced my fear and tried other chiropractic 6 months after incident thinking it would realign & heal things (Gonstead 3 sessions & CBP 2 sessions) which didn't help, as well as more massage and a lot of home PT.  Just recently started seeing a NUCCA (upper cervical) guy that does a technique called QSM3... pretty sure it's bogus and isn't doing a thing.\n\nI have no numbness/weakness/tingling, and nothing that travels down my arms.  I occasionally get a burning sensation across my left trap.  I can feel within my left trap that theres an extremely tight band of muscle that feels almost like a bone when flexed, and it is when I use my trap that I get the electric shock sensation along that same path - the more I use it, the larger the shock.  If I reach behind my head, trap flexed, and palpate the taught band of muscle near my neck/paraspinal region, I get the electric sensation.  If my arm is relaxed down to my side and I palpate this same region even with a lot of pressure, no zings.  I'm starting to get occasional little zaps on the right side of my neck too (mid paraspinal) -- top right of my neck is also very crunchy and tight.  I seem to want to support my head a lot, so I am suspecting some ligament laxity/weakness is at play.  The clicking/cracking in my neck seems to be increasing.\n\nX-Rays:  [Lateral view]( | [Flexion & Extension]( | [Front view](\n\nI had a [cervical MRI](  6 months after the incident that revealed multi-level mild uncovertebral hypertrophy, a 1.6mm, 5.2mm wide bulge at C7-T1 ([Lateral]( [Slice]( that may hit the ventral nerve root on the left, as well as a C3-C4 2mm bulge ([Lateral 1]( [Lateral 2]( [Slice](\n\nI had a [Thoracic MRI 2 weeks later]( and the record said that it seemed the bulge at C7-T1 may have undergone interval desiccation or resorption, but I find that unlikely.  My T1-T2 has lost some height and I have bilateral facet arthrosis ([Lateral thoracic]( | [1st Slice]( | [2nd Slice]( | [3rd Slice](  I'm curious how bad the facet arthritis is, if anyone has expertise -- the top portion of the lateral view looks odd/concerning to me.  It's starting to pop & click and ache more and more, even without movement in bed.  Happy to provide more views, not sure if I grabbed all the right ones.\n\n[Here is the 3mm Bulge at T5-T6]( which was from the accident, and been a pretty consistent dull/sharp aching point and also clicks all the time.\n\nDoctor has recommended an epidural steroid injection at C7-T1 which I've resisted.  I've read about the possible complications, how it is contraindicated by the FDA for cervical use, and how it really only helps if you have symptoms going down the arms (but really they're only approved for sciatica type leg pain).  I recently tried a steroid dosepak as a less invasive method, but that gave no symptom relief at all.  Read that steroids are only a band-aid and will do nothing to fix the structural issue.\n\nJust looking for more opinions -- do my symptoms sound more facet related than disc related?  It's the intermittent nature that has me stumped.   I've been looking into PRP & Stem Cell injections into my facets, possibly an epidural with Platelet Lysate from my own blood.  Really would prefer something regenerative vs catabolic.\n\nWould a CT Scan of my cervical region provide any further answers on what to treat given the mechanism of injury?  Would a standing/sitting MRI be helpful?  Ultrasound?  Digital Motion X-Ray?\n\nI'm growing hopeless that this will be my new normal and trying to find answers to hopefully correct what's going on and slow down the degeneration (yes perhaps obsessively... but hey, it's my health and I'm only 33).\n\nThank you for your time.",
    "document": "Chiropractic care and the risk of vertebrobasilar stroke: results of a case\u2013control study in U.S. commercial and Medicare Advantage populations\nBackground \n             There is controversy surrounding the risk of manipulation, which is often used by chiropractors, with respect to its association with vertebrobasilar artery system (VBA) stroke. The objective of this study was to compare the associations between chiropractic care and VBA stroke with recent primary care physician (PCP) care and VBA stroke. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             The study design was a case\u2013control study of commercially insured and Medicare Advantage (MA) health plan members in the U.S. population between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013. Administrative data were used to identify exposures to chiropractic and PCP care. Separate analyses using conditional logistic regression were conducted for the commercially insured and the MA populations. The analysis of the commercial population was further stratified by age (<45\u00a0years; \u226545\u00a0years). Odds ratios were calculated to measure associations for different hazard periods. A secondary descriptive analysis was conducted to determine the relevance of using chiropractic visits as a proxy for exposure to manipulative treatment. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             There were a total of 1,829 VBA stroke cases (1,159 \u2013 commercial; 670 \u2013 MA). The findings showed no significant association between chiropractic visits and VBA stroke for either population or for samples stratified by age. In both commercial and MA populations, there was a significant association between PCP visits and VBA stroke incidence regardless of length of hazard period. The results were similar for age-stratified samples. The findings of the secondary analysis showed that chiropractic visits did not report the inclusion of manipulation in almost one third of stroke cases in the commercial population and in only 1 of 2 cases of the MA cohort. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             We found no significant association between exposure to chiropractic care and the risk of VBA stroke. We conclude that manipulation is an unlikely cause of VBA stroke. The positive association between PCP visits and VBA stroke is most likely due to patient decisions to seek care for the symptoms (headache and neck pain) of arterial dissection. We further conclude that using chiropractic visits as a measure of exposure to manipulation may result in unreliable estimates of the strength of association with the occurrence of VBA stroke.",

In the U.S., there are several millions of lifetime users, and millions each year added to the list as new users. Only several thousand every year show signs of severe toxicity and require emergency intervention. The illness is known as serotonin (5-HT) syndrome, which can be mild, moderate or severe. The relationship between mild, moderate and severe syndromes appears to be interchangeable, but the severe syndrome is life-threatening. The serotonergic mechanisms of how the mild or moderate syndrome becomes severe and life-threatening have attracted considerable attention in the last few years as an effort to explore new treatments potentially to manage illness and prevent death of patients. High levels of extracellular 5-HT in the brain produced by large doses of MDMA are not always necessary to cause a severe serotonin syndrome. Additional mechanisms may be more important. Recent research has demonstrated that environmental conditions (i.e., non-drug factors) are more critical in determining the severity of MDMA-induced serotonin syndrome than the drug dose.

We also analyze an ever increasing number of alternative therapies claiming to provide enhanced scar reduction performance. \n           Recent Advances:  Topical silicone gel treatments seem to remain the first point of clinical recommendation in scar management.

However, there still is ongoing deliberation over the exact mechanism of action of silicone in improving a scar. At present it is likely that through occlusion of the scar site and hydration of the wound bed, the overactivity of scar-related cells is suppressed, and their activity normalized. \n           Future Direction:  The clinical support of topical silicone gel products, relative to all alternative scar therapies, is considered the internationally recommended first-line form of scar management, and favored by consensus among healthcare professionals.

However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

    "question": "Hello! I am currently following a calorie restriction diet. I have followed this diet before but this time around Ive been following it for about 3 weeks. Because I am eating so much less than I need my cortisol levels have skyrocketed. Symptoms include fatigue, headaches, severe clenching of the jaw, and severe insomnia (I can and have gone several days without sleep). This only happens when I am restricting calories and I have determined that it is likely caused by stress. I know elevated cortisol levels can be very harmful to your health. My question is, how long can I endure elevated stress levels before I start to encounter detriments to my health?

This started out as what was thought to be some atypical migraine - severe pain behind the eye that would sometimes shoot down to the ear that simply would not go away. Occasional nausea but no symptoms aside from that. Day 4 she went to urgent care and received IM Zofran and 60mg IM Toradol. This helped greatly.....for about 18 hours. Day 7 she couldn\u2019t take it anymore and went to the ER (the wait for the ER was because she was uninsured and open season for insurance for my company was literally in 8 days). So they do a CT scan. Everyone\u2019s affect immediately changes, they begin doing q1min neuro checks, me being and RN myself my heart drops to the floor. The MD comes in and says the found what look to be some bleeding and they\u2019re transferring her to a trauma hospital immediately... fast forward to the trauma facility the MRI shows a spontaneous subdural hematoma. The kicker is they simply cannot find the cause. No clots, no anuersym, no vascular abnormalities, no trauma, no medications taken regularly, no medical history whatsoever aside from ovarian cysts. So neurosurgery and hematology run every lab in the book. EVERYTHING is normal (we\u2019re still waiting on some specific clotting factor tests). Everyones stumped. The bleed doesn\u2019t even completely correspond to where her pain is. Shes in excruciating pain that is responding somewhat to Fioricet and IV Decadron Q8H. They monitor the bleed with repeat CTs and it\u2019s stable. So fast forward 4 days later here we are home. With no answers. Follow ups with neurosurgeon and hematology.She is in complete agonizing pain. D/Cd with fioricet q4h and a Medrol pack. Please ask any questions you need.

    "question": "Hi everyone.  I am crossposting this to /r/Stims, /r/AskDrugNerds and /r/AskDocs since I expect vastly different answers in each.  I hope that isn't breaking any rules.\n\nMy Data (as per /r/AskDocs reqs):  \nAge: 37  \nSex: Male  \nHeight: 177cm  \nWeight: 115kg (currently)  \nLocation: Central Europe  \nRelevant medical conditions: Obesity  \nCurrent medications: None (other than illegally acquired amphetamine)  \n\nAround 5 years ago, I realised I was very overweight.  I always knew I was fat, but it hit me that at my age, being 140kg is just not normal and carries with it significant health risks.\n\nI started eating better and exercising.  It worked for a bit and after a lot of struggle, I got down as low as 120kg, but I was mentally exhausted from the effort.  Everything I read about weight loss told me that if its a struggle, you're likely to put the weight on again and it should be \"with care, but a change that you can stick to forever\".  That's something I couldn't do.  No matter what I tried, anything that actually resulted in any weight loss was too difficult to stick to.\n\n6 months ago, I was back up at 140kg.  So I tried something different.  I got my hands on some amphetamine paste (illegally).  After \"washing\" it to remove impurities as per instructions I found online, I had about 50% of the original weight left, so for the sake of the rest of this post, let's assume I did it correctly and I have some pretty pure speed.\n\nFor the first 1 month, I took 10mg every morning when I woke up.  Since then, I've taken 25mg every morning when I wake up.  I'll drink it with a single cup of relatively weak coffee (I used to drink a lot of coffee, but since taking the amphetamine, this is my only caffeine consumption as I've heard/read there are risks to using both together)\n\nEvery second weekend, I don't take any for the 2 days and self-assess my mental state for signs of craving/addiction and personality/mood changes.  So far, I haven't detected any nor has anyone I know commented on my personality/behaviour (other than congratulating me on my weight loss).\n\nI exercise lightly but easily and eat whatever I feel like.  I simply feel like eating much less.  Smaller portions, but a range of food from healthy through to junk, depending on what I'm in the mood for.\n\nI'm now (as mentioned above) down to 115kg and honestly am feeling great.  I'd like to get down to 90kg and then maybe try increasing some of my exercise in the direction of muscle training so I can maybe even tone my body a bit.\n\nSo, on to my questions...\n\nQ1: I'm aware that amphetamine carries certain physical risks including damage to the heart and liver.  How serious are these risks compared to being morbidly obese?\n\nQ2: Assuming I don't increase my dosage any further, what real risks are there of continuing this pattern of use indefinitely?  Is it really all that different from people who are prescribed adderall and take it daily?\n\nQ3: If I decide to continue taking it 'forever' (realising full well that many will likely advise I do not do so), how can I minimise the potential harm from my usage (e.g. other supplements, activities, diet, etc)?",

    "response": "The first thing I want to point out here to everyone is methamphetamine and amphetamine are not the same. Are they chemically similar? Yes, the basic difference is methamphetamine's second methylation compared to amphetamine. This difference changes its interactions with your brain chemistry, resulting in meth being a much more potent stimulant and causing much more potent side effects. (source: \n\nIn regards to amphetamine use long term; medically, people are prescribed amphetamine for lots of different things, from ADHD to weight loss for long periods. Long term use of a prescribed amphetamine can definitely cause neurodegeneration, tolerance and possibly cardiac effects in older or pre-disposed adults. Studies do come out discovering new things all the time, it's possible some other serious side effects may be unearthed. \n\nHowever, this is information is in reference to PRESCRIBED amphetamine level. A doctor has calculated the prescribed level and the medical combination of  d/l- amphetamine is precisely regulated by the FDA. What you are taking is illegal amphetamine paste at self prescribed dosages. It is likely unregulated. Simple chemical changes (as above) can drastically change the toxic effects a drug has on you body. This is the most complicating and concerning part of your question. Who knows what chemicals and types stimulants are really in that paste and how their long term use could affect your body. I think this is more concerning than the long term use of a prescribed amphetamine. \n\nObviously lifestyle changes are the most recommended solution but if you are dead set on long term amphetamine use I would strongly suggest seeing your doctor, explaining your situation and getting a prescription for a regulated amphetamine."

Herbal products are complex mixtures of organic chemicals that may come from any raw or processed part of a plant, including leaves, stems, flowers, roots, and seeds. Under the current law, herbs are defined as dietary supplements, and manufacturers can therefore produce, sell, and market herbs without first demonstrating safety and efficacy, as is required for pharmaceutical drugs. Although herbs are often perceived as \u201cnatural\u201d and therefore safe, many different side effects have been reported owing to active ingredients, contaminants, or interactions with drugs. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Unfortunately, there is limited scientific evidence to establish the safety and efficacy of most herbal products.

    "document": "Ovarian Follicular Development During the Use of Oral Contraception: A Review\nOver the past 40 years, alterations to the composition of oral contraceptives (OCs) have been made in attempts to reduce adverse effects and to improve patient compliance while maintaining contraceptive efficacy. However, there is growing evidence to indicate that reducing the estrogen dose to minimize adverse effects may have compromised the degree of hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian suppression, particularly during the hormone-free interval (HFI) or following missed doses. Follicle development during OC use appears to occur in association with a loss of endocrine suppression during the HFI. This information provides a rationale for reducing or eliminating the HFI in OC regimens. There is also evidence for an increased risk of follicle development and ovulation in women who use delayed OC initiation schemes, such as the \u201cSunday Start\u201d method. It is not currently known why some follicles ovulate during OC use while others regress or form anovulatory follicle cysts. Continued research about follicle development during OC use would provide insight into understanding the precise mechanisms of action underlying combined OCs, as well as those of continuous OC formulations and emergency contraceptive regimens.",

    "document": "Contraception and endometriosis: challenges, efficacy, and therapeutic importance\nEndometriosis is a benign gynecological condition that is estimated to affect 10% of women in the general population and appears to be increasing in incidence. It is an estrogen-dependent inflammatory disease, and is primarily characterized by dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain, and variable effects on fertility. The symptoms may greatly affect quality of life, and symptom control may be the primary aim of initial management, while contraceptive effect is often secondary. It is estimated that 30%\u201350% of women with endometriosis have an infertility problem, so a considerable number of endometriosis sufferers will require effective, planned contraception to maximize \u201cprotection of fertility\u201d and prevent progression of the endometriotic condition. Ideally, this contraception should also provide symptom relief and improvement of physical, mental, and social well-being. At the present time, long-term progestogens appear to be the most effective choice for meeting all of these requirements, but other options need to be considered. It is becoming increasingly recognized that hormonal contraceptive systems are necessary for prevention of disease recurrence following surgical treatment of endometriosis. The personal preferences of the woman are an integral part of the final contraceptive choice. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the contraceptive options available to women with endometriosis.",

Diagnosis and Treatment of Lyme Arthritis\nSYNOPSIS \n           In the United States, Lyme arthritis is the most common feature of late stage infection with the tick-borne spirochete,  Borrelia burgdorferi , usually beginning months after the initial tick bite. However, in some patients, including most of those seen today, the earlier phases of the infection are asymptomatic and arthritis is the presenting manifestation of the disease. Patients with Lyme arthritis have intermittent or persistent attacks of joint swelling and pain in one or a few large joints, especially the knee, usually over a period of several years, without prominent systemic manifestations. Serologic testing is the mainstay of diagnosis. Synovial fluid PCR testing for  B. burgdorferi  DNA is often positive prior to treatment, but it is not a reliable marker of spirochetal eradication after antibiotic therapy. Responses to oral or intravenous antibiotic treatment are generally excellent, although a small percentage of patients have persistent synovitis after 2-3 months of oral and IV antibiotics, which usually then responds to anti-inflammatory therapies, disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), or synovectomy. This chapter reviews the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of Lyme arthritis.",

We included studies that enrolled patients with COVID-19 treated with CQ or HCQ, with or without azithromycin, and reported on cardiac toxic effects. We performed a meta-analysis using the arcsine transformation of the different incidences. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             A total of 19 studies with a total of 5652 patients were included. The pooled incidence of torsades de pointes arrhythmia, ventricular tachycardia, or cardiac arrest was 3 per 1000 (95% CI, 0-21;  I 2 =96%) in 18 studies with 3725 patients. Among 13 studies of 4334 patients, the pooled incidence of discontinuation of CQ or HCQ due to prolonged QTc or arrhythmias was 5% (95% CI, 1-11;  I 2 =98%). The pooled incidence of change in QTc from baseline of 60 milliseconds or more or QTc of 500 milliseconds or more was 9% (95% CI, 3-17;  I 2 =97%).

Yet, our understanding of neuroendocrine bases of paternal behavior in humans is still preliminary and more research is needed in this area. In the present review, the authors summarized hormonal bases of paternal behavior in both human and nonhuman mammalian species and focused on studies on the regulatory role of prolactin in occurrence of paternal behavior. All peer-reviewed journal articles published before 2015 for each area discussed (parental brain, hormonal bases of maternal behavior, hormonal bases of paternal behavior and the role of prolactin in regulation of paternal behavior in nonhuman mammalian species, hormonal bases of paternal behavior and the role of prolactin in regulation of paternal behavior in humans) were searched by PubMed, Medline, and Scopus for original research and review articles. Publications between 1973 and 2015 were included. Similar to female parents, elevated prolactin levels in new fathers most probably contribute to child-caring behavior and facilitate behavioral and emotional states attributed to child care. Moreover, elevated parental prolactin levels after childbirth decrease the parents\u2019 libidos so that they invest more in parental care than in fertility behavior. According to the available clinical studies, elevation in the amounts of prolactin levels after childbirth in male parents are probably associated with paternal behavior observed in humans.",

    "document": "Reversal of liver cirrhosis: current evidence and expectations\nIn the past, liver cirrhosis was considered an irreversible phenomenon. However, many experimental data have provided evidence of the reversibility of liver fibrosis. Moreover, multiple clinical studies have also shown regression of fibrosis and reversal of cirrhosis on repeated biopsy samples. As various etiologies are associated with liver fibrosis via integrated signaling pathways, a comprehensive understanding of the pathobiology of hepatic fibrogenesis is critical for improving clinical outcomes. Hepatic stellate cells play a central role in hepatic fibrogenesis upon their activation from a quiescent state. Collagen and other extracellular material components from activated hepatic stellate cells are deposited on, and damage, the liver parenchyma and vascular structures. Hence, inactivation of hepatic stellate cells can lead to enhancement of fibrolytic activity and could be a potential target of antifibrotic therapy. In this regard, continued efforts have been made to develop better treatments for underlying liver diseases and antifibrotic agents in multiple clinical and therapeutic trials; the best results may be expected with the integration of such evidence. In this article, we present the underlying mechanisms of fibrosis, current experimental and clinical evidence of the reversibility of liver fibrosis/cirrhosis, and new agents with therapeutic potential for liver fibrosis.",
    "response": "The body can normally heal itself pretty well, and minor damage to your organs happens all the time with no lasting side effects. For an obvious example, if you get a cut or scrape on your skin (which is an organ), it heals most of the time very quickly and easily and with no evidence that it was damaged. But if the damage is too much, the body loses the ability to specifically regrow exactly what was there, so it just paves the area over with tough fibrous tissue that doesn't really *do* anything useful but will keep the structure intact--a scar. The same thing happens in all of your organs. Your liver can regenerate very well, but too much damage over time and the whole thing becomes full of scar tissue and nonfunctional (this is called cirrhosis).\n\nImagine you have a house. If a window gets broken, you can just get a new window and nobody can tell the difference.

This article examines the empirical literature pertaining to recurrently expressed beliefs regarding DID: (1) belief that DID is a fad, (2) belief that DID is primarily diagnosed in North America by DID experts who overdiagnose the disorder, (3) belief that DID is rare, (4) belief that DID is an iatrogenic, rather than trauma-based, disorder, (5) belief that DID is the same entity as borderline personality disorder, and (6) belief that DID treatment is harmful to patients. The absence of research to substantiate these beliefs, as well as the existence of a body of research that refutes them, confirms their mythical status. Clinicians who accept these myths as facts are unlikely to carefully assess for dissociation. Accurate diagnoses are critical for appropriate treatment planning. If DID is not targeted in treatment, it does not appear to resolve. The myths we have highlighted may also impede research about DID. The cost of ignorance about DID is high not only for individual patients but for the whole support system in which they reside. Empirically derived knowledge about DID has replaced outdated myths.

The candidate genotype can be causally connected to a clinical phenotype using cellular (leukocytes) or molecular (plasma) substrates. The recent advent of next generation sequencing (NGS), with whole exome and whole genome sequencing, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, and gene editing technologies\u2014including in particular the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 technology\u2014offer new and exciting possibilities for the genetic exploration of single patients not only in hematology and immunology but also in other fields. We propose three criteria for deciding if the clinical and experimental data suffice to establish a causal relationship based on only one case. The patient\u2019s candidate genotype must not occur in individuals without the clinical phenotype. Experimental studies must indicate that the genetic variant impairs, destroys, or alters the expression or function of the gene product (or two genetic variants for compound heterozygosity). The causal relationship between the candidate genotype and the clinical phenotype must be confirmed via a relevant cellular phenotype, or by default via a relevant animal phenotype. When supported by satisfaction of rigorous criteria, the report of single patient\u2013based discovery of Mendelian disorders should be encouraged, as it can provide the first step in the understanding of a group of human diseases, thereby revealing crucial pathways underlying physiological and pathological processes.",

(Great, sounds lovely, thanks doc). \n\nBut anyway, I\u2019ve always wanted to get an IUD, because I heard they can be better for you than the pill and help with bad period pain, etc. I\u2019ve always had longer periods (like 7 days long) with really bad pain - \u2018taking full doses of ibuprofen and Panadol and still needing a heat pack\u2019 type pain - and changing between pill brands didn\u2019t help at all.

This study aims to evaluate the performance of a 90-gene expression signature in determining the primary sites for BM samples. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             The sequence-based gene expression profiles of 708 primary brain tumors (PBT) collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed by the 90-gene expression signature, with a similarity score for each of 21 common tumor types. We then used Optimal Binning algorithm to generate a threshold for separating PBT from BM. Eighteen PBT samples were analyzed to substantiate the reliability of the threshold. In addition, the performance of the 90-gene expression signature for molecular classification of metastatic brain tumors was validated in a cohort of 48 BM samples with the known origin. For each BM sample, the tumor type with the highest similarity score was considered tissue of origin. When a sample was diagnosed as PBT, but the similarity score below the threshold, the second prediction was considered as the primary site. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             A threshold of the similarity score, 70, was identified to discriminate PBT from BM (PBT: >\u00a070, BM:\u2009\u2264\u200970) with an accuracy of 99% (703/708, 95% CI 98\u2013100%).

    "document": "Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures: so-called psychiatric comorbidity and underlying defense mechanisms\nIn  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition, psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) do not have a unique classification as they can be found within different categories: conversion, dissociative, and somatization disorders. The ICD-10, instead, considers PNES within dissociative disorders, merging the dissociative disorders and conversion disorders, although the underlying defense mechanisms are different. The literature data show that PNES are associated with cluster B (mainly borderline) personality disorders and/or to people with depressive or anxiety disorders. Defense mechanisms in patients with PNES with a prevalence of anxious/depressive symptoms are of \u201cneurotic\u201d type; their goal is to lead to a \u201csplit\u201d, either vertical (dissociation) or horizontal (repression). The majority of patients with this type of PNES have alexithymia traits, meaning that they had difficulties in feeling or perceiving emotions. In subjects where PNES are associated with a borderline personality, in which the symbolic function is lost, the defense mechanisms are of a more archaic nature (denial). PNES with different underlying defense mechanisms have different prognoses (despite similar severity of PNES) and need usually a different treatment (pharmacological or psychological). Thus, it appears superfluous to talk about psychiatric comorbidity, since PNES are a different symptomatic expression of specific psychiatric disorders.",

The resulting articles were then categorized and reviewed. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The literature search revealed a total of 458 publications, almost all published after 1992. The percentages of original studies and review articles are 77.29% (354) and 22.71% (104), respectively. Among the original studies, the number of reports on inflammation of human DED is 200 (43.7%); animal models, 115 (25.1 %); and cell cultures, 39 (8.5 %). The human DED studies reveal changes of numerous inflammatory cells and mediators in ocular surface and tear film and those changes can be attenuated or reversed by anti-inflammatory drug treatments. The animal DED studies demonstrate that DED is likely a dominant T-lymphocytes, especially T-helper 17-subset (Th17)-mediated autoimmune disease and that the autoimmune-driven inflammatory cycles are fundamentally linked with DED progression. These results are mirrored and confirmed by a number of corneal and conjunctival epithelial cell culture studies that clearly demonstrate an inflammatory immune response pattern when those cells are exposed to desiccation, inflammatory mediators or high osmolarity shock. A yearly distributing plot revealed that 76% were published from 2003 to 2011, 53% from 2008 to 2012, and 11% during the first 9 months of 2013. This distribution signifies a rapidly growing awareness of the importance of inflammation in DED pathogenesis. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             The literature review study clearly demonstrate that inflammation is the core mechanism and plays a key role in the pathogenesis of DED as evidenced by research utilizing tissue culture, animal models and subjects with DED. The chronicity of the disease suggests that dysregulation of immune mechanisms leads to a cycle of continued inflammation, accompanied by alterations in both innate and adaptive immune responses. Therefore, developing biomarkers to monitor the ocular surface inflammatory status will not only improve our knowledge to fully understand the mechanisms leading to DED, to better classify the severity of DED, to measure the objective metrics for outcome of treatment, but also provide directions to develop effective and safe anti-inflammatory treatments that will be beneficial for patients with DED.",

A total of 52 studies (with 3,623 patients) met inclusion criteria, 32 on depressive disorders and 21 on anxiety disorders (one on both depressive and anxiety disorders). The overall difference between pharmacotherapy and combined treatment was Hedges' g\u2009=\u20090.43 (95% CI: 0.31-0.56), indicating a moderately large effect and clinically meaningful difference in favor of combined treatment, which corresponds to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4.20. There was sufficient evidence that combined treatment is superior for major depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The effects of combined treatment compared with placebo only were about twice as large as those of pharmacotherapy compared with placebo only, underscoring the clinical advantage of combined treatment. The results also suggest that the effects of pharmacotherapy and those of psychotherapy are largely independent from each other, with both contributing about equally to the effects of combined treatment. We conclude that combined treatment appears to be more effective than treatment with antidepressant medication alone in major depression, panic disorder, and OCD. These effects remain strong and significant up to two years after treatment. Monotherapy with psychotropic medication may not constitute optimal care for common mental disorders.",

Patellar tendinopathy can cause significant functional deficits, yet little has been reported about the operative treatment of patellar tendinopathy. \n           \n           \n             Hypothesis: \n             A combined arthroscopic and open surgical technique for the treatment of recalcitrant patellar tendinopathy results in an improvement in function and pain at a minimum 2-year follow-up. The purpose of this study was to present the indications, combined surgical technique, rehabilitation protocol, and the 2-year minimum follow-up results of the operative treatment of recalcitrant patellar tendinopathy. \n           \n           \n             Study Design: \n             Retrospective case series. \n           \n           \n             Methods: \n             A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent a surgical primary patellar tendon debridement for recalcitrant patellar tendinopathy by a single surgeon between July 1999 and December 2005. Every patient failed at least 1 year of nonoperative treatment. Patients were excluded from the study if they had previous open knee surgery. Validated patient-reported outcome scores were used to assess function and pain levels pre- and postoperatively (Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee, Tegner activity, and visual analog pain score). \n           \n           \n             Results: \n             Thirty-four consecutive patients (37 consecutive cases) with mean follow-up 3.8 \u00b1 1.6 years (range, 2-7.6 years) underwent the procedure with no complications. The mean age at surgery was 29 years (range, 14-51 years). Postoperatively, the visual analog score decreased by an mean of 6 points (range, 1 to \u221210,  P  < 0.001), and patients were able to return to their preinjury Tegner activity level. When asked if they were satisfied by the overall outcome of their surgery, 28 patients (82%) were completely or mostly satisfied with their surgical outcome on a particular knee; 6 (18%) were somewhat satisfied; and 2 (6%) were dissatisfied. Twenty-seven patients (79%) said they would have the surgery again. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion: \n             The combined arthroscopic and open surgical technique described for chronic recalcitrant patellar tendinopathy successfully reduces knee pain and allows return to preinjury level of activity.",

    "document": "Carcinoid syndrome: update on the pathophysiology and treatment\nApproximately 30-40% of patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors present with carcinoid syndrome, which is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with the secretion of several humoral factors. Carcinoid syndrome significantly and negatively affects patients' quality of life; increases costs compared with the costs of nonfunctioning neuroendocrine tumors; and results in changes in patients' lifestyle, such as diet, work, physical activity and social life. For several decades, patients with neuroendocrine tumors and carcinoid syndrome have been treated with somatostatin analogues as the first-line treatment. While these agents provide significant relief from carcinoid syndrome symptoms, there is inevitable clinical progression, and new therapeutic interventions are needed. More than 40 substances have been identified as being potentially related to carcinoid syndrome; however, their individual contributions in triggering different carcinoid symptoms or complications, such as carcinoid heart disease, remain unclear. These substances include serotonin (5-HT), which appears to be the primary marker associated with the syndrome, as well as histamine, kallikrein, prostaglandins, and tachykinins. \n           Given the complexity involving the origin, diagnosis and management of patients with carcinoid syndrome, we have undertaken a comprehensive review to update information about the pathophysiology, diagnostic tools and treatment sequence of this syndrome, which currently comprises a multidisciplinary approach.",

Very rarely, initial signs include skin manifestations. Our purpose is to highlight cutaneous manifestations in the diagnosis and assessment of a patient with atypical manifestation of type I gastric carcinoid tumor. \n           \n           \n             Case presentation \n             A 50-year-old woman presented with anemia, chronic urticaria and angioedema. Urticaria was triggered principally by seafood and appeared in the first hour after. Urticaria Activity Score 7 was 24, and quality of life (CU-Q2oL) was 3.61. P. Laboratory findings showed anemia, diminished iron, ferritin, and vitamin B12, with increased gastrin and anti-parietal cell antibody levels. 15 gastric carcinoids 5\u00a0mm in diameter were observed in the greater curvature of the stomach during gastric endoscopy and confirmed by biopsy, suggesting that this patient had type I gastric carcinoids. Four additional tumors were found in the small intestine upon examination via video capsule. Endoscopic argon plasma therapy was performed.

(initially, but has since lost a significant amount of weight)  \nRace - Korean-American  \nComplaint - Sudden cognitive decline followed by loss of almost all motor skills  \nDuration - Beginning late June/early July  \nPre-existing Conditions - Arthritis  \nCurrent Meds - Arthritis medication (not sure which), has been prescribed multiple meds since this started, but unsure of what  \nDrinks - Socially; Recreational drugs - No  \nFully vaccinated and negative for COVID\n\nFrom my friend:  \nA week before July 4th he was starting to get headaches. He was taking some new medication for arthritis and it was also causing him to be tired and not talk as much, so my mom thought it was just a side effect. She said she would ask him questions but he wouldn\u2019t respond to her. She thought he was just depressed Bc he wasn\u2019t feeling well and couldn\u2019t go out and meet his friends and be active.\n\nFast forward to July 4th and he had severe memory loss. He didn\u2019t know my name or my brother's name so we got him to the ER. They gave him a bunch of antibiotics because he also had a fever over 100, and then checked him in.\n\nThey did a whole bunch of tests including a spinal tap, CAT scan, and brain MRI and everything came back clear. Originally they thought it was meningitis, but since the tests were negative they concluded it wasn\u2019t. He was released after a week and prescribed a bunch of meds (not sure what).\n\nSince mid-July he has been home and on and off. Some days he was ok, other days he was slow and sluggish, but for the most part better. He had no fever, he could feed himself, take showers, etc., it just took 2-3x longer than it would normally take.\n\nAbout a week ago, one evening when he got up to go to the restroom, he couldn\u2019t make it back to bed and my mom found him on the bathroom floor. Then a couple of days later it happened again on the way to the bathroom. He couldn\u2019t get up or move and my mom couldn\u2019t move him so she left him on the hallway floor and called me in the morning to help him back to bed. That was last Monday (8/23).\n\nThen she talked to his primary care doc and told him what was going on and he said take him to the ER ASAP since his condition was getting worse. So, we took him that afternoon and ever since then it has been a rapid decline.\n\nSo far, they did 2 CT scans (the second one was to make sure his brain isn\u2019t bleeding because he hasn\u2019t been talking and is less responsive). He also had a spinal MRI which didn\u2019t find anything, and they are going to schedule a spinal tap this week.\n\n\\--\n\nHis condition is rapidly getting worse and my friend and her family are getting more and more desperate.

A small percentage of them are rapidly progressive and mostly carry a different course outcome. However, there are no definite criteria other than the time line for these patients. \n           \n           \n             Aims: \n             The aim of this was to identify and categorize the causes and course of rapidly progressive dementias seen in our center. \n           \n           \n             Settings and Design: \n             Patients who presented with rapid deterioration of cognitive functions within weeks to 1 year between 2011 and December 2016 were evaluated. \n           \n           \n             Patients and Methods: \n             All patients underwent all mandatory tests for dementia including brain imaging. Complete vasculitis workup, autoimmune encephalitis profile including Voltage Gated Potassium Channel, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor, glutamic acid-decarboxylase, thyroid-peroxidase antibody, cerebrospinal fluid, and other special tests such as duodenal biopsy and paraneoplastic workup were done based on clinical indications. \n           \n           \n             Results and Conclusions: \n             Out of 144 patients 42 had immune-mediated encephalopathy, 18 had Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, 3 had Vitamin B12 deficiency, 63 had infection with neurocysticercosis, 7 had tuberculosis, 2 had HIV, 1 had herpes simplex encephalitis, 1 had neurosyphilis, 1 Whipples disease, 1 had Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis, 1 had Mass lesion, 3 had Frontotemporal dementia, and 3 had small vessel disease.

    "response": "Thanks for posting and sorry to hear your friend and his family are going through this. He definitely needs to be in a hospital with whatever is going on, and your friend is best off speaking with the doctor's taking care of his father directly to get answers. They should ensure there is a neurologist involved in his care since that seems to be the system that is primarily being affected here. \n\nThat being said, I'd characterize his condition as a subacute onset of progressive altered mental status +/- generalized weakness with a possible inflammatory component (fevers, weight loss, etc.) and no clear structural lesion in the central nervous system. The list of possible categories fitting this description is broad, but would include:\n\n\\- primary neurodegenerative disease (FTD, Lewy body dementia, CJD)\n\n\\- inflammatory (vasculitis, paraneoplastic syndromes, autoimmune disease)\n\n\\- metabolic (hyperammonemia, B12 deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency)\n\n\\- infectious (too many possibilities to list and testing would be guided by additional history or laboratory findings, though should include testing for HIV, viral hepatidities, syphilis, and Lyme disease if endemic in your region).\n\nAs far as testing, when they do the next spinal tap, they should test the fluid not just for signs of meningitis, but for antibodies specific to some of the conditions listed above (a neurologist would be the best person to determine what). Additional helpful blood tests include a NH3, B12 level, MMA level, TSH, cortisol, ESR, CPR, ANA, and serologies for HIV, HCV, and HBV. Additionally, they should consider another MRI brain at this point to see if some process that was too early to be visualized a month ago is now present. An EEG wouldn't hurt either to ensure he's not having seizures. If the weakness he is having is significant, an EMG should be considered as well.  \n\nI imagine the hospital staff where he is being treated has already looked into many of these possibilities, but it may be worth asking just to be thorough. Additionally, if his family feels that he is not getting answers or getting better at the current facility, it is never wrong to ask to be transferred to a larger, more academic hospital where they might have better luck of diagnosing a rare condition. Good luck to this patient and your friend and hope this helps."

    "document": "Living-related lung transplantation\nLiving-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT) was developed to deal with the severe shortage of brain dead door for patients who would not survive the long waiting period. In standard LDLLT, right and left lower lobes removed from two healthy donors are implanted into a recipient after right and left pneumonectomies using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The number of LDLLT has decreased in the USA due to the recent change in allocation system for cadaveric donor lungs. For the past several years, most of the reports on LDLLT have been from Japan, where the average waiting time for a cadaveric lung is exceeding 800 days. LDLLT has been performed both for adult and pediatric patients suffering from various end-stage lung diseases including restrictive, obstructive, vascular and infectious lung diseases. Since only two lobes are implanted, size matching is a very important issue. Functional size matching by measuring donor pulmonary function and anatomical size matching by three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) volumetry are very useful. For oversize graft, we have employed several techniques, including single lobe transplantation, delayed chest closure, downsizing the graft, and middle lobe transplantation. In cases of undersize mismatch, native upper lobe sparing transplant or right-left inverted transplant was performed. The 5-, 10- and 15-year survivals were 80.8%, 72.6% and 61.7%, respectively. There was no difference in survival between standard LDLLT and non-standard LDLLT such as single, sparing and inverted transplant. All donors have been discharged without any restrictions. LDLLT is a viable option for very ill patients who would not survive a long waiting time for cadaveric lungs.

This paper reviews and synthesizes quantitative research examining relationships between R/S involvement and depressive symptoms or disorders during the last 50 years (1962 to 2011). At least 444 studies have now quantitatively examined these relationships. Of those, over 60% report less depression and faster remission from depression in those more R/S or a reduction in depression severity in response to an R/S intervention. In contrast, only 6% report greater depression. Of the 178 most methodologically rigorous studies, 119 (67%) find inverse relationships between R/S and depression. Religious beliefs and practices may help people to cope better with stressful life circumstances, give meaning and hope, and surround depressed persons with a supportive community. In some populations or individuals, however, religious beliefs may increase guilt and lead to discouragement as people fail to live up to the high standards of their religious tradition. Understanding the role that R/S factors play in preventing depression, facilitating its resolution, or leading to greater depression will help clinicians determine whether this is a resource or a liability for individual patients.",

So, I\u2019ve posted here once about a supposed black \u2018ring of death\u2019 on my inner cheek, and was diagnosed to have a traumatic mouth ulcer (probably from eating some super hot eggs). Give it two weeks, and it\u2019ll be gone. \n\nIn celebrating that two weeks, I am here to say that the ulcer has decided on extending its stay, and honestly seems as though it\u2019s getting bigger.

I\u2019m calling to go to the doctor by next week, but I need some reassurance or my anxiety is gonna kill me. I\u2019ve been looking online and some sites point to it being a melanotic macule, while others point to oral melanoma. The growth is honestly what\u2019s putting me off the most. \n\nI\u2019ve pretty much counted out it being some form of HSV, seeing as it doesn\u2019t look (or feel) as such, but I\u2019m still putting off acts of passion at the moment.

Interestingly, oral lesions may be amelanotic in up to 10\u201330% of cases; in these patients, diagnosis may be challenging (Tomicic and Wanebo, 2003;Tanaka et al., 2004; Sun et al., 2012). Oral MM may have either a nodular or macular appearance (Tanaka et al., 1994; Wu et al., 2014). Macular lesions are flat, and up to one-third of patients have a long history of mucosal pigmentation (melanosis) (Lyu et al., 2016; Warszawik-Hendzelet al., 2014), which is considered the radial growth phase before invasion of underlying tissues (vertical growth phase). Nodular tumours, conversely, have an irregular surface and present as ulcerated, exophytic lesions. Haemorrhage and ulceration are usually a late occurrence, associated with the vertical growth of the lesion(Meleti et al., 2007). As with the sinonasal tract, it is also possible to observe satellite lesions in the oral cavity (Lyu et al., 2016;Hicks and Flaitz, 2000). The most involved sites are the hard palate, maxillary gum and mandibular gum (Sun et al., 2012; Wu et al.,2014)  \n>  \n>Ascertio et al [\n\nThe odds are very much in your favor, but I would definitely recommend taking it seriously and seeking a professional opinion."

Around 20 mins later it has turned into a paste, most of it is still under my cheek, it tastes bitter but I feel no pain whatsoever.

    "document": "Buccal acetaminophen provides fast analgesia: two randomized clinical trials in healthy volunteers\nBackground \n             Acetaminophen (APAP) by oral or intravenous (iv) routes is used for mild to moderate pain but may take time to be effective. When fast relief is required and/or oral or iv routes are not available because of the patient\u2019s condition, the transmucosal route may be an alternative. \n           \n           \n             Methodology \n             A new transmucosal/buccal (b) pharmaceutical form of APAP dissolved in 50% wt alcohol is compared with other routes of administration. Two consecutive randomized, crossover, double-blind clinical trials (CT1: NCT00982215 and CT2: NCT01206985) included 16 healthy volunteers. CT1 compared the pharmacology of 250 mg bAPAP with 1 g iv APAP. CT2 compared the pharmacodynamics of 125 mg bAPAP with 1 g iv and 125 mg sublingual (s) APAP. Mechanical pain thresholds are recorded in response to mechanical stimuli applied on the forearm several times during 120 minutes. The objective is to compare the time of onset of antinociception and the antinociception (area under the curve) between the routes of administration with analysis of variance (significance  P <0.05). \n           \n           \n             Results \n             bAPAP has a faster time of antinociception onset (15 minutes,  P <0.01) and greater antinociception at 50 minutes ( P <0.01, CT1) and 30 minutes ( P <0.01, CT2) than ivAPAP and sAPAP. All routes are similar after 50 minutes. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             bAPAP has a faster antinociceptive action in healthy volunteers.

    "response": "Yes, it should be safe as long as you don't exceed maximum dosage limits of course. \n\nDoes it work like you think it does? Not really. Acetaminophen (=paracetamol) doesn't work locally. What happens here is that it most probably gets absorbed in your bloodstream through your oral mucosa. This route of administration usually results in quicker absorption of the drug. This in combination with a little bit of the placebo effect (and your focus on the bitter taste) most likely results in adequate pain control in your case. \nTaking one tablet orally would probably give the same effect, but it might take a bit longer to notice and generally comes more gradually.\nBut hey, this works for you, so that's great! If you ever get tired of that awful taste though, know that you can always switch back to the regular route :)"

It's not that these issues and obesity just happen to occur together, but the issues arise from being obese. \n\nYou are more likely to develop heart disease because the heart is having to work harder to pump blood to much more tissue. If you're obese, you have a lot of fat on you and in your blood. When you have fat in your blood, it can clump together and form a clot which will cause a stroke or heart attack. Being obese can activate the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system, which will lead to insulin resistance and sodium reabsorption, which will lead to hypertension and diabetes. The increased weight in your head and neck can lead to sleep apnea, which is a risk factor for things like heart disease and stroke.

    "document": "Role of sympathetic nerve activity in the process of fainting\nSyncope is defined as a transient loss of consciousness and postural tone, characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous recovery, and the process of syncope progression is here described with two types of sympathetic change. Simultaneous recordings of microneurographically-recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and continuous and noninvasive blood pressure measurement has disclosed what is going on during the course of syncope progression. For vasovagal or neurally mediated syncope, three stages are identified in the course of syncope onset, oscillation, imbalance, and catastrophe phases. Vasovagal syncope is characterized by sympathoexcitation, followed by vagal overcoming via the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Orthostatic syncope is caused by response failure or a lack of sympathetic nerve activity to the orthostatic challenge, followed by fluid shift and subsequent low cerebral perfusion. Four causes are considered for the compensatory failure that triggers orthostatic syncope: hypovolemia, increased pooling in the lower body, failure to activate sympathetic activity, and failure of vasoconstriction against sympathetic vasoconstrictive stimulation. Many pathophysiological conditions have been described from the perspectives of (1) exaggerated sympathoexcitation and (2) failure to activate the sympathetic nerve. We conclude that the sympathetic nervous system can control cardiovascular function, and its failure results in syncope; however, responses of the system obtained by microneurographically-recorded MSNA would determine the pathophysiology of the onset and progression of syncope, explaining the treatment effect that could be achieved by the analysis of this mechanism.",

However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations.

Infections negative. \u00a0Blood cultures normal.\n\nI can post the tests if anyone needs to see them.\n\n**3.** **Bruises and Rotting Platelets**\n\nNormally I don\u2019t bruise any more than most people. \u00a0\u00a0But once in a while, I get bruises everywhere. \u00a0My bra, underwear, and socks all leave big bruises. \u00a0They\u2019re painless and go away in a couple weeks so I never worried about it. \u00a0But when a doctor saw and tested, it turned out there were almost no platelets. \u00a0\n\nThe picture shows the bruising left by a loose sock. \u00a0My whole shins were just big bruises that followed the pattern of the sock elastic.\n\n(picture)\n\nIn a few weeks they were back up to 40 and the bruises were gone. \u00a0\n\nHematologist found no reason for platelets to suddenly drop like this. \u00a0\n\nThey checked for cancers and even took bone marrow but no answers.\n\n(picture)\n\nAll the bone marrow tests like fish and genetics were normal. \u00a0\n\n**4.** **Symptoms that Seem Autoimmune but Have No Rheumatologic Cause.** \u00a0\n\nSometimes I get rashes and swellings that doctors think is autoimmune\n\n(pictures)\n\nRheumatology has tested EVERYTHING again and again. \u00a0Sedimentation rate, ferritin, and CRP are always high. \u00a0But nothing else is usually abnormal.\n\n(pictures)\n\nThey biopsied some of the rashes and purpuras (which I don\u2019t have pictures of, they\u2019re just little painless red spots that sometimes break out on my legs). \u00a0They all showed the same thing, \u201cleukocyto elastic vasculitis\u201d. \u00a0Here\u2019s one.\n\n(picture)\n\nBut every other type of test for vasculitis has been negative. \u00a0\u00a0Nobody has explained why someone healthy and pretty young like me should have \u2018chronic venous insufficiency\u2019 either.\n\nI have only had one round of tests where there were any abnormal autoimmune results:\n\n(picture)\n\nBut these things were only abnormal that ONE TIME. \u00a0Rheumatology has re-tested them so many more times and they are always normal. \u00a0They have tested for every other autoimmune disease and they are all normal. \u00a0\n\nThe only rheumatology tests that are often abnormal are sediment rate, creactive, and ferritin being high. \u00a0\u00a0Ddimer and visc is sometimes high but not usually. \u00a0PT, INR, and ptt are sometimes high too. \u00a0\n\n(picture)\n\nThey don\u2019t think it\u2019s cryoglobinemia because it was only positive once and negative a lot more times. \u00a0Also, my C4 was always high or normal and my C3 was always normal, even in the test where there was cryoglobulin. \u00a0\n\n(picture)\n\nThe only other thing off on the bloodwork is subclinical hypothyroid. \u00a0\u00a0TSH is high, but T3 and 4 are low normal. \u00a0I have no symptoms of \u00a0hypothyroid other than being cold. \u00a0And the cold could be from anemia. \n\n**Please, does anybody know what this all means?**\n\nI had accepted the lack of answers when it was just random blood rotting, swelling, and rashes. \u00a0I know the doctors tried hard. \u00a0I could live with all that stuff. \u00a0\n\nBut these black fingers, I can\u2019t live with it. \u00a0It hurts too much. \n\nIt feels like someone as healthy as me shouldn\u2019t have all these symptoms unless it\u2019s connected somehow. \u00a0But nobody knows how. \u00a0Rheumatology thinks the rotten blood is not autoimmune because Coombs and other autoimmune tests are always normal. \u00a0But hematology says if it\u2019s not autoimmune, then there\u2019s no other answers. \u00a0\n\nSo far, I have no autoimmune diagnoses but doctors still act like I have something autoimmune.\n\nMonday I will see my NP and can ask for any tests anybody recommends.\n\n**IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR THE FINGERS AND TOES? \u00a0TO MAKE THE BLACK GO AWAY OR MAKE THEM STOP HURTING?**\n\nI already tried asking a pain forum for tips, but I got a nasty message (\u201cYour complaining about\u00a02 weeks of hurt fingers! \u00a0Do you understand that we have pain that is severe, intractable and forever*?*\u00a0\u00a0I have ddd and a herniated L5-S1 disc. \u00a0I am in 10/10 agony beyond your imagination. \u00a0Your hurty finger is a joke. \u00a0Suck it up buttercup\u201d) so I deleted it and won\u2019t ask for help from patients again.\n\nI hope doctors will be more understanding.\u00a0*I get it*, that there are other people who have it much, much worse. \u00a0\u00a0But I don\u2019t have chronic pain so I never developed a high pain tolerance. \u00a0Typing this is killing me. I\u2019ve had a broken bones, a vaginal delivery, wisdom tooth surgery, and swollen joints, but none of those hurt that bad. \u00a0When I\u2019ve broken a bone, it\u2019s only been blindingly painful for ten or fifteen minutes, then it settles down. \u00a0Then a few days of throbbing and aching that\u2019s relieved with rest and Advil. \u00a0\n\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve had pain that Advil can\u2019t relieve and that doesn\u2019t settle down with time or rest. \u00a0I know other people with bad backs or arthritis have it worse. \u00a0I don\u2019t need to be told that. \u00a0But *for me*, this is too much. \u00a0\n\n**What can cause this?**\n\nThe doctors seem confident that it\u2019s *not* just psychological.\n\nBut I can\u2019t shake the fact that I get more symptoms when I\u2019m sad or stressed. \u00a0I don\u2019t have any chronic mental illnesses, but I go through short periods of feeling down or anxious. \u00a0At the hospital, I held it together when they took off the black thumb. \u00a0I told myself that it was ok, that the pain was finally gone, that half a thumb isn\u2019t that important, that it\u2019s my non-dominant hand, that I don\u2019t need a full left thumb to type or do most activities. \u00a0When I got home, I was so happy to be pain free and I had so much to catch up on, I just didn\u2019t think about it. \u00a0But then I looked at the discharge paperwork and saw that under \u201cReason For Visit,\u201d they wrote \u201cGANGRENE, WET\u201d. \u00a0I knew that the thumb wasn\u2019t good, but seeing it called \u201cGANGRENE\u201d made me feel so repulsive and sad. \u00a0I spent 10 or 15 minutes just crying. \u00a0\n\nIt was right after that little breakdown that all the other fingers started hurting and turning black. \u00a0Could all that crying have caused it?\n\nThere\u2019s also an odd discrepancy. \u00a0My black fingers hurt so much but my black toes don\u2019t hurt at all. \u00a0How is that possible unless the pain is all in my head?\n\nI am desperate for answers or relief if anyone can help. \u00a0**Thank you to anyone who has read this far.**\n\nTL-DR: \u00a0What causes rotting fingers, rotting blood, rotting platelets, leukocyto elastic vasculitis, swelling, rashes, purpuras, and maybe subclinical hypothyroidism but without showing up on normal blood tests for autoimmune or other diseases?",
    "document": "The Clinical Pictures of Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia\nSummary \n           Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is characterized by shortened red blood cell survival and a positive Coombs test. The responsible autoantibodies may be either warm reactive or cold reactive. The rate of hemolysis and the severity of the anemia may vary from mild to severe and life-threatening. Diagnosis is made in the laboratory by the findings of anemia, reticulocytosis, a positive Coombs test, and specific serologic tests. The prognosis is generally good but renal failure and death sometimes occur, especially in cases mediated by drugs.",
    "response": "This is beyond the scope of all but the most seasoned hematologists and rheumatologists. It MUST be rheumatologic or a bone marrow disorder, nothing else fits all the symptoms. You should be referred out to Mayo Clinic or John\u2019s Hopkins or something.  I would say the rapid progressions warrants an inpatient workup until a cause or treatment can be found. If those fingers/toes get infected you could get septic pretty quick. \n\nSome type of small vessel vasculitis fits best, but they\u2019ve tested for all the obvious culprits so it\u2019s hard to say why nothing has been found yet. It\u2019s definitely not in your head, but it\u2019s no surprise that stress makes the symptoms worse. Stress makes a lot of things worse.  \n\nI wish I could offer you more, but this definitely isn\u2019t my field of practice. Hopefully someone else has some ideas."

    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

    "question": "To elaborate from the title, my mum was in a car accident two decades ago which resulted in her left foot being severed and re-attached, her left leg is shorter and pelvis tilted resulting in back pain that has increased over the years. On top of that, she\u2019s got fibromyalgia and ME. Her pain is so severe every day that she is bed bound, she will go for days without sleep because it\u2019s so bad. She has been prescribed 20mg oxycodone, which she can take 3x a week for \u201cbreakthrough pain\u201d and has over the counter strength codeine that she takes 3x a day every day, she\u2019s also on 75mg amatriptalyne every night for sleep, and she\u2019s on Prozac 60mg daily for mental health.

Back then, she was able to work, and live her life very happily. \n\nShe went to the pain clinic to ask for an increase of 3x to 5x a week, and they basically told her that she\u2019s imagining her pain so she needs to change her mindset, and gave her some book to read about it being all in her head. The person said she can\u2019t prescribe more pain medication than that due to guidelines, and even if she could then she wouldn\u2019t because of the effects of opiates on the body. But my mum feels like she would rather be pain free and be able to live her life. \n\nWe are at a bit of an impasse now because she doesn\u2019t want to be labled as a drug seeker, but she can\u2019t continue living the way she does.

    "document": "Early and effective use of ketamine for treatment of phantom limb pain\nTreatment for phantom limb pain is difficult and challenging. There is often suboptimum treatment with fewer than 10% receiving lasting relief. Treatments based broadly on other neuropathic pains may not be appropriate for a clinical success. We report a case of phantom limb pain, which proved resistant to multiple analgesics, including opioids and continuous epidural blockade. Treatment with intravenous (IV) ketamine as an alternate day infusion, gave complete remission of phantom limb pain. This demonstrates an early and effective use of a potent NMDA antagonist for treatment of phantom limb pain. Mechanisms underlying phantom limb pain are briefly discussed.",
    "response": "tl;dr  She should read the book they gave her and return to discuss an individual plan for her unique circumstances, one that doesn't include more opioid medication. \n\n\nHmm. This is a tough one, because what people are told and what they hear are often very different. Many people hear, \"It's all in your head,\" and think they are being told that their pain is imaginary. This is not usually the case.\n\nLiterally, all chronic pain is happening in your head because that's where your brain is and your brain tells you what's going on. What doctors usually mean when they say it's in your head is that the pain is not due to an inflammation or and abnormality of the muscles/joints of the body. That old injury or surgery isn't the reason for your current pain; it's a habit that your nervous system got into complaining about despite the initial problem resolving however it resolved. Habits are really hard to break, especially when the brain does it on its own. \n\nPhantom limb pain is a good example. Someone has a terrible injury or a reason that their leg gets amputated. The foot that isn't there anymore but it hurts all the time or wakes the person with terrible pain. The amputation isn't why the foot hurts. The foot can't hurt because it's no longer there! The reason the foot hurts despite not existing any longer is the brain knows something is wrong and it's complaining. Turning off that habitual signal that the foot is a problem is a tough problem. \n\nThis kind of pain is an amplification of sensitization within the brain that results in the normal signals of the body being interpreted as intense and painful when they should not be. I'm simplifying it a lot, but the parts of the brain involved in sleep, pain, integration of sensory input, memory, mood, and cognition aren't operating normally. Something has changed. We can't make it go back, at least not at the current state of understanding. Some changes in the brain can't be reversed (autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc). The problems can only be managed as best as possible. Like many other brain conditions, there is a strong genetic component in the central sensitivitization syndromes, though what those genes are and what to do about it are still areas of research. \n\nFor most people with central sensitization, daily/weekly pain level for their chronic pain syndrome is relatively stable. It can vary with stress and changes in activity, but the general range of their pain doesn't change much over years. \n\nOpioid pain medications usually make the *intensity* of the pain experience worse over time. Often, people do feel better for a little while, but in the longer term, the pain levels overall are higher for people taking opioid medications. When I've weaned people down or off, and I have longitudinal information on them about their complaints, I have *always* seen lower overall pain reports on lower opioid doses or no opioid medications as compared to how the patients reported their symptoms while on higher doses. They might say the felt better or functioned better with higher doses, but my charts show that their recollection isn't accurate for what they said at the time. \n\nOpioid medications are addictive and are able to easily cause tolerance that leads to higher doses used. There is higher mortality in people using opioid pain medications without better function, as compared to people with similar chronic pain who don't take opioid medications. In other words, your mum might feel great for a little while because of the dopaminergic reward effects of the opioid and temporary reduction of pain, but the long term management should not include opioid medications for daily use because a) it will actually increase her experience of her pain and b) it's potentially deadly, besides causing lots of side effects. \n\nMany people have relief of their anxiety and depression  when they take opioid medications. However, these drugs usually cause anxiety and depression as discontinuation symptoms or there are underlying problems that are revealed and/or persist after stopping the drug. Optimal treatment of mood and anxiety conditions absolutely should *not* include opioid medications. It's trial and error to get people on a regimen that helps them, and I'm sorry that we don't have any fantastically amazing, guaranteed treatment strategies for people like your mum, who have these central sensitization syndromes. \n\nWhat does work for managing chronic pain? Exercise (it takes a few months but is only guarantee that I give). Get enough sleep. Pace daily activities. Manage stress. Regularity of routine. The hardest stuff is what helps the best. Much easier to take a pain pill, but that isn't what works in the long run. Medications to help the brain get out of the cycle of what drives the symptoms are mostly trial and error. Most of the prescriptions are helpful for sleep, mood, and for some neuropathic pain problems. Sometimes, opioid antagonists actually improve the responses to the person's own endogenous opiate neurotransmitters. OT, PT, hypnosis, ice, and a lot of other treatments can be helpful for many people. Cannabioids might help, but access can get problematic depending on locale and expense. \n\nYour mum should return to her pain doctor to discuss how best to manage her symptoms without more opioid medication, because they've already told her that's not an option under current guidelines. Why isn't it an option when she got those prescriptions in the past? Because too many people died while taking those dosages, without any clear benefits on pain or other measures of objective improvement. \n\nNote: Purdue and the Sackler family paid experts to lie about the lethal and addiction consequences of oxycodone because they knew they'd get millions of people addicted and they didn't care about millions of opioid-related deaths when trillions of dollars were going into their bank accounts. Then they got legal immunity by paying out a lot for legal services. They still have trillions or quadrillions in their accounts, without any consequences to them personally for the deaths and suffering that they deliberately promoted. Your mum is one of the victims of their planned campaign. I'm sorry for that. It's very hard for people who remember how good they felt on the drugs to see how the drugs were not the right choice. \n\nI wish you & your mum well. I hope you can get to a point of understanding why the pain management strategies don't include opioid medications anymore. Reality is that chronic opioid therapy makes people worse.\n\nEdited to fix typos\n\nEdit2: This comment has had a lot of attention. Thank you to everyone for the awards. If anyone who sees this post after the active discussion is in a situation like OP or OP's mum, I hope that you will get help from experts who have experience in managing chronic pain. It is difficult and frustrating, but you can have improvement in your individual, unique situation. \n\nBecause someone mentioned suicide in the comments, here's important information: in the USA, 1-800-273-8255\u00a0(TALK) is 24/7 National Suicide Prevention Hotline.

    "document": "Oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain\nAbstract \n           \n             Background \n             Pain is a common symptom with cancer, and 30% to 50% of all people with cancer will experience moderate to severe pain that can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Non\u2010opioid drugs are commonly used to treat mild to moderate cancer pain, and are recommended for this purpose in the WHO cancer pain treatment ladder, either alone or in combination with opioids. \n             A previous Cochrane review that examined the evidence for nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or paracetamol, alone or combined with opioids, for cancer pain was withdrawn in 2015 because it was out of date; the date of the last search was 2005. This review, and another on NSAIDs, updates the evidence. \n           \n           \n             Objectives \n             To assess the efficacy of oral paracetamol (acetaminophen) for cancer pain in adults and children, and the adverse events reported during its use in clinical trials. \n           \n           \n             Search methods \n             We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase from inception to March 2017, together with reference lists of retrieved papers and reviews, and two online study registries. \n           \n           \n             Selection criteria \n             We included randomised, double\u2010blind, studies of five days' duration or longer, comparing paracetamol alone with placebo, or paracetamol in combination with an opioid compared with the same dose of the opioid alone, for cancer pain of any intensity. Single\u2010blind and open studies were also eligible for inclusion. The minimum study size was 25 participants per treatment arm at the initial randomisation. \n           \n           \n             Data collection and analysis \n             Two review authors independently searched for studies, extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality and potential bias. We did not carry out any pooled analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table. \n           \n           \n             Main results \n             Three studies in adults satisfied the inclusion criteria, lasting up to one week; 122 participants were randomised initially, and 95 completed treatment. We found no studies in children. One study was parallel\u2010group, and two had a cross\u2010over design. All used paracetamol as an add\u2010on to established treatment with strong opioids (median daily morphine equivalent doses of 60 mg, 70 mg, and 225 mg, with some participants taking several hundred mg of oral morphine equivalents daily). Other non\u2010paracetamol medication included non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, or neuroleptics. All studies were at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and small size; none was unequivocally at low risk of bias. \n             None of the studies reported any of our primary outcomes: participants with pain reduction of at least 50%, and at least 30%, from baseline; participants with pain no worse than mild at the end of the treatment period; participants with Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved (or equivalent wording). What pain reports there were indicated no difference between paracetamol and placebo when added to another treatment. There was no convincing evidence of paracetamol being different from placebo with regards to quality of life, use of rescue medication, or participant satisfaction or preference. Measures of harm (serious adverse events, other adverse events, and withdrawal due to lack of efficacy) were inconsistently reported and provided no clear evidence of difference. \n             Our GRADE assessment of evidence quality was very low for all outcomes, because studies were at high risk of bias from several sources. \n           \n           \n             Authors' conclusions \n             There is no high\u2010quality evidence to support or refute the use of paracetamol alone or in combination with opioids for the first two steps of the three\u2010step WHO cancer pain ladder. It is not clear whether any additional analgesic benefit of paracetamol could be detected in the available studies, in view of the doses of opioids used. \n           \n        \n           Plain language summary \n           \n             Paracetamol for cancer pain \n           \n           \n             Bottom line \n           \n           There is no evidence to show that paracetamol is useful in treating people with cancer pain, either alone or combined with a morphine\u2010like drug. Nor is there evidence to disprove that it is useful. There are no good studies evaluating paracetamol for management of cancer pain. \n           \n             Background \n           \n           One person in two or three who gets cancer will suffer from pain that becomes moderate or severe in intensity. The pain tends to get worse as the cancer progresses. In 1986, the World Health Organization recommended taking morphine\u2010like drugs (opioids) for moderate to severe pain from cancer, and non\u2010opioid drugs like paracetamol, alone for mild to moderate pain, or alongside opioids in people with moderate to severe pain. \n           \n             Study characteristics \n           \n           In this review we set out to examine all the evidence on how well paracetamol (alone or with morphine\u2010like drugs) worked in adults and children with cancer pain. We also wanted to know how many people had side effects, and how severe those side effects were, for example, whether they caused people to stop taking their medicines. \n           In March 2017, we found three studies with 122 participants. All compared paracetamol plus opioid with the same dose of opioid alone. The studies were small, and were of poor quality. They used different study designs and different ways of showing their pain results. Outcomes of importance to people with cancer pain were not reported. \n           \n             Key findings \n           \n           We found no evidence that taking paracetamol alone made any difference to the level of pain experienced. We found no evidence that taking paracetamol together with a morphine\u2010like drug was better than the morphine\u2010like drug alone. Paracetamol did not appear to improve quality of life. No conclusions could be reached about side effects. The amount of information and the differences in how studies were reported meant that no conclusions could be made. \n           \n             Quality of the evidence \n           \n           The quality of the evidence was very low. Very low\u2010quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the impact of paracetamol for treating cancer pain. We do not know whether using paracetamol alone, or in combination with an opioid such as codeine or morphine, is worthwhile.",

This is a tough one, because what people are told and what they hear are often very different. Many people hear, \"It's all in your head,\" and think they are being told that their pain is imaginary. This is not usually the case.\n\nLiterally, all chronic pain is happening in your head because that's where your brain is and your brain tells you what's going on. What doctors usually mean when they say it's in your head is that the pain is not due to an inflammation or and abnormality of the muscles/joints of the body. That old injury or surgery isn't the reason for your current pain; it's a habit that your nervous system got into complaining about despite the initial problem resolving however it resolved. Habits are really hard to break, especially when the brain does it on its own. \n\nPhantom limb pain is a good example. Someone has a terrible injury or a reason that their leg gets amputated. The foot that isn't there anymore but it hurts all the time or wakes the person with terrible pain. The amputation isn't why the foot hurts. The foot can't hurt because it's no longer there! The reason the foot hurts despite not existing any longer is the brain knows something is wrong and it's complaining. Turning off that habitual signal that the foot is a problem is a tough problem. \n\nThis kind of pain is an amplification of sensitization within the brain that results in the normal signals of the body being interpreted as intense and painful when they should not be. I'm simplifying it a lot, but the parts of the brain involved in sleep, pain, integration of sensory input, memory, mood, and cognition aren't operating normally. Something has changed. We can't make it go back, at least not at the current state of understanding. Some changes in the brain can't be reversed (autism, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc). The problems can only be managed as best as possible. Like many other brain conditions, there is a strong genetic component in the central sensitivitization syndromes, though what those genes are and what to do about it are still areas of research. \n\nFor most people with central sensitization, daily/weekly pain level for their chronic pain syndrome is relatively stable. It can vary with stress and changes in activity, but the general range of their pain doesn't change much over years. \n\nOpioid pain medications usually make the *intensity* of the pain experience worse over time. Often, people do feel better for a little while, but in the longer term, the pain levels overall are higher for people taking opioid medications. When I've weaned people down or off, and I have longitudinal information on them about their complaints, I have *always* seen lower overall pain reports on lower opioid doses or no opioid medications as compared to how the patients reported their symptoms while on higher doses. They might say the felt better or functioned better with higher doses, but my charts show that their recollection isn't accurate for what they said at the time. \n\nOpioid medications are addictive and are able to easily cause tolerance that leads to higher doses used. There is higher mortality in people using opioid pain medications without better function, as compared to people with similar chronic pain who don't take opioid medications. In other words, your mum might feel great for a little while because of the dopaminergic reward effects of the opioid and temporary reduction of pain, but the long term management should not include opioid medications for daily use because a) it will actually increase her experience of her pain and b) it's potentially deadly, besides causing lots of side effects. \n\nMany people have relief of their anxiety and depression  when they take opioid medications. However, these drugs usually cause anxiety and depression as discontinuation symptoms or there are underlying problems that are revealed and/or persist after stopping the drug. Optimal treatment of mood and anxiety conditions absolutely should *not* include opioid medications. It's trial and error to get people on a regimen that helps them, and I'm sorry that we don't have any fantastically amazing, guaranteed treatment strategies for people like your mum, who have these central sensitization syndromes. \n\nWhat does work for managing chronic pain? Exercise (it takes a few months but is only guarantee that I give). Get enough sleep. Pace daily activities. Manage stress. Regularity of routine. The hardest stuff is what helps the best. Much easier to take a pain pill, but that isn't what works in the long run. Medications to help the brain get out of the cycle of what drives the symptoms are mostly trial and error. Most of the prescriptions are helpful for sleep, mood, and for some neuropathic pain problems. Sometimes, opioid antagonists actually improve the responses to the person's own endogenous opiate neurotransmitters. OT, PT, hypnosis, ice, and a lot of other treatments can be helpful for many people. Cannabioids might help, but access can get problematic depending on locale and expense. \n\nYour mum should return to her pain doctor to discuss how best to manage her symptoms without more opioid medication, because they've already told her that's not an option under current guidelines. Why isn't it an option when she got those prescriptions in the past?

    "question": "To elaborate from the title, my mum was in a car accident two decades ago which resulted in her left foot being severed and re-attached, her left leg is shorter and pelvis tilted resulting in back pain that has increased over the years. On top of that, she\u2019s got fibromyalgia and ME. Her pain is so severe every day that she is bed bound, she will go for days without sleep because it\u2019s so bad. She has been prescribed 20mg oxycodone, which she can take 3x a week for \u201cbreakthrough pain\u201d and has over the counter strength codeine that she takes 3x a day every day, she\u2019s also on 75mg amatriptalyne every night for sleep, and she\u2019s on Prozac 60mg daily for mental health. It is only when she takes her oxy that she is pain free for 6 hours and able to do simple things like take the dog for a walk, tidy up around the house, chuck in a load of laundry or get a good night\u2019s sleep.\n\nShe used to be on 20mg oxy 3x a day, and was on that dose for 5 years without going up. Back then, she was able to work, and live her life very happily. \n\nShe went to the pain clinic to ask for an increase of 3x to 5x a week, and they basically told her that she\u2019s imagining her pain so she needs to change her mindset, and gave her some book to read about it being all in her head. The person said she can\u2019t prescribe more pain medication than that due to guidelines, and even if she could then she wouldn\u2019t because of the effects of opiates on the body. But my mum feels like she would rather be pain free and be able to live her life. \n\nWe are at a bit of an impasse now because she doesn\u2019t want to be labled as a drug seeker, but she can\u2019t continue living the way she does. Her mental health is so bad because she is living in constant pain, she is basically being imprisoned and tortured in her own body with no escape. Where do we go from here? We are based in the U.K.",

Upon transfer to hormone-free medium, the cytokinin-treated cells released more of their [ 14 C]2,4-D than did the control cells. Initial exposure to low 2,4-D and high kinetin levels resulted in the greatest release of 2,4-D upon subsequent transfer. The observed alteration in 2,4-D metabolism did not seem to be correlated with growth rate. Appropriate treatment of soybean cells with kinetin resulted in 2,4-D metabolism that resembled the 2,4-D metabolism of embryogenic carrot cells. However, no new morphological structures were observed in these soybean cultures, indicating that other factors are related to the failure of soybean cells to regenerate in culture.",

    "document": "The 1-Year Mortality of Patients Treated in a Hip Fracture Program for Elders\nComanagement of geriatric hip fracture patients with standardized protocols has been shown to improve short-term outcomes after surgery. A standardized, patient-centered, comanaged Hip Fracture Program for Elders is examined for 1-year mortality. Patients \u226560 years of age who were treated in the Hip Fracture Program for Elders were comanaged by orthopaedic surgeons and geriatricians. Data including age, place of origin, procedure, length of stay, 1-year mortality, Charlson score, and activities of daily living (ADLs) were retrospectively collected. A total of 758 patients \u226560 years of age with hip fractures between April 15, 2005, and March 1, 2009, were included. Their data were analyzed, and the Social Security Death Index and the hospital data system were searched for mortality data. Seventy-eight percent were female, with a mean age of 84.8 years. The mean Charlson score was 3. Fifty percent were admitted from an institutional setting. The overall 1-year mortality was 21.2%. Age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00-1.05;  P  = .02), male gender (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.01-2.36;  P  = .04), low Parker mobility score (OR = 2.94, 95% CI = 1.31-6.57;  P  = .01), and a Charlson score of 4 or greater (OR = 2.15, 95% CI = 1.30-3.55;  P  = .002) were predictive of 1-year mortality. ADL dependence was a borderline predictor, as was medium Parker mobility score. Prefracture residence and moderate comorbidity (Charlson score of 2-3) were not independently predictive of mortality at 1 year after adjusting for other characteristics. A comprehensive comanaged hip fracture program for elders not only improves the short-term outcomes but also demonstrates a low 1-year mortality rate, particularly in patients from nursing facilities.",
    "response": "I'm sorry this happened. Hip fracture in the elderly is a really challenging conversation to have. It's stressful and a lot of time the trauma can seem so minor compared to the degree of injury and it makes no sense. Trauma just sucks and feels unfair and for that I'm sorry.  \n\nMath and probability may help answer your question so I'll say the following:\n\n1. Out of all people needing hip fracture surgery, 1 in 5 die within 1 year\n2. Advanced age makes the probability somewhat higher\n3. A much stronger predictor of how well she'll do is how independent she was prior to surgery. For example, if she's a 97yo who lives alone, does all her daily house chores herself, and goes on a daily mile-long walk - that's someone more likely to do well than a 97yo who has advanced dementia and lives in a nursing home (someone in this category could be looking at up to a 70+% chance of dying within 1 year of surgery) \n4. Blindness greatly increases her risk of getting confused after surgery (as her brain starts waking up from anesthesia) \n5. Despite how high these risks seem, if she doesn't get surgery she will never walk again, and will likely pass away from complications in 1-3 months.\n\nOverall, as Nelferd mentioned, if the doctors and surgeons are recommending it, it's because they think that the benefits of the surgery outweigh the risks. In general, I tend to recommend hip fracture surgery to anyone who had a life expectancy of >6 months before the injury happened.  \n\n[citation]("

All three patients were novice surfers showing a typical clinical course of rapid progression of paraplegia following the onset of back pain. Typical history and magnetic resonance imaging features indicated the diagnosis of surfer\u2019s myelopathy. Two patients received high-dose steroid therapy and the other was treated with induced hypertension. One patient treated with induced hypertension showed almost full recovery; however, two patients who received high-dose steroid therapy remained completely paraplegic and required catheterization for bladder and bowel dysfunction despite months of rehabilitation. Our case series demonstrates the potentially devastating neurological outcome of surfer\u2019s myelopathy; however, early recovery in the initial 24\u201372 hours of presentation can occur in some patients, which is in accordance with previous reports. Ischemic insult to the spinal cord is thought to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of surfer\u2019s myelopathy. Treatment recommendations include hydration, induced hypertension, early spinal angiography with intra-arterial intervention, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, and high-dose steroid therapy; however, there is no standardized treatment option available. Early recovery appears to be important for long-term neurological outcome. Induced hypertension for initial treatment can be helpful for improving spinal cord perfusion; therefore, it is important for early and long-term neurological recovery. Education and awareness are essential for preventing surfer\u2019s myelopathy and avoiding further deterioration of neurological function.",

It\u2019s ruined my most important development years, I\u2019ve never had a girlfriend, lost all my mates and I\u2019ve tried everything. \n\nThe worst thing I find about this condition is there is no break. Once the skin has painfully peeled off, it\u2019s raw, hurts and within 12 hours I can feel the buildup coming. It\u2019s constant and it\u2019s right slap on the centre of my face, the worst place it could be. I\u2019m really exhausted and have tried so so so many things, it\u2019s my life\u2019s focus, there hasn\u2019t been a day in the last 5 years where I haven\u2019t researched what I can do. \n\nAs well as the peeling, my lips get inflamed and have a sort of red border around them after eating most foods, laughing and also after climaxing. It makes my look like a literal clown. I don\u2019t eat out any more. This made me think it was histamine in the food I was eating but I\u2019ve kinda ruled that out now. My theories are: leaky gut\u2026 mast cell activation syndrome\u2026.or some sort of hormone issue. I\u2019ve been send all round the country to different doctors, with no success.

    "document": "Glycerin Borax Treatment of Exfoliative Cheilitis Induced by Sodium Lauryl Sulfate: a Case Report\nThis paper reports on the results of a case study of a 19-year-old female who presented to the Oral Medicine clinic with a chief complaint of scaly and peeling lips. The lesions had persisted on her lips for more than 7 years and were refractory to previous treatment. Her physician\u2019s diagnosis was contact dermatitis. We diagnosed this patient as having exfoliative cheilitis (EC). A patch test using the toothpaste containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) was positive and the patient discontinued using it. Instead, she started using a toothpaste not containing SLS. One year after treating her lesions with hydrogen peroxide mouthwash 1% and glycerin borax, a gradual improvement was observed until returning to normal. Glycerin borax was safe, low cost and simple to use in treatment of refractory exfoliative cheilitis. SLS may have been a precipitating factor in EC in this case.",
    "response": "Exfoliative cheilitis is very often reactive. It can be caused by lip licking, sucking, picking, an infection of sorts, an allergic reaction or, in some cases, localised psoriasis.\n\nTo rule out infection (bacterial or fungal), swabs can be taken and sent for culture. If you find yourself licking/sucking/picking at your lips a lot, try to be aware if and when you're doing it, and stop yourself from continuing. I know from experience it's very annoying to have loose skin on your lips, and it can be very hard to resist the urge to pick at those scabs, but to have any chance of getting better you'll need to stop yourself from doing it."

    "response": "There is no way for me to say for sure without knowing more of your grandmother's past medical history, what her fracture looks like, and what her current state of health is  (vitals, blood work, physical exam, etc.). However, I will encourage you to ask the tough questions. Why does your grandmother not want surgery? And what does she want instead? Ask your grandmother what her priorities are in terms of her medical care so her wishes can be respected. You can request a palliative care consult, which are experts in having discussions about goals of care. They are also experts in providing care at home so people can be comfortable in the end of life and have the optimizing quality of life given a patient's situation.\n\nFalls and hip fractures are very, very, very serious in the elderly. At 97 years old, a hip fracture is very concerning. Like I said I can't say for sure, but without treatment she is unlikely to survive and go back to her previous quality of life. Even with prompt treatment, the situation still would have been serious. If your grandmother wishes to decline any further treatment and want to die at home in peace, then I encourage you to fight for that and let your grandmother's wishes be heard. Talk to her and ask her what she wants, in the end that's the most important thing."

    "document": "Persistent clotting protein pathology in Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) is accompanied by increased levels of antiplasmin\nBackground \n             Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2)-induced infection, the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is characterized by acute clinical pathologies, including various coagulopathies that may be accompanied by hypercoagulation and platelet hyperactivation. Recently, a new COVID-19 phenotype has been noted in patients after they have ostensibly recovered from acute COVID-19 symptoms. This new syndrome is commonly termed Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Here we refer to it as Long COVID/PASC. Lingering symptoms persist for as much as 6\u00a0months (or longer) after acute infection, where COVID-19 survivors complain of recurring fatigue or muscle weakness, being out of breath, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Given that blood clots can block microcapillaries and thereby inhibit oxygen exchange, we here investigate if the lingering symptoms that individuals with Long COVID/PASC manifest might be due to the presence of persistent circulating plasma microclots that are resistant to fibrinolysis. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We use techniques including proteomics and fluorescence microscopy to study plasma samples from healthy individuals, individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), with acute COVID-19, and those with Long COVID/PASC symptoms. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             We show that plasma samples from Long COVID/PASC still contain large anomalous (amyloid) deposits (microclots). We also show that these microclots in both acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC plasma samples are resistant to fibrinolysis (compared to plasma from controls and T2DM), even after trypsinisation. After a second trypsinization, the persistent pellet deposits (microclots) were solubilized. We detected various inflammatory molecules that are substantially increased in both the supernatant and trapped in the solubilized pellet deposits of acute COVID-19 and Long COVID/PASC, versus the equivalent volume of fully digested fluid of the control samples and T2DM. Of particular interest was a substantial increase in \u03b1(2)-antiplasmin (\u03b12AP), various fibrinogen chains, as well as Serum Amyloid A (SAA) that were trapped in the solubilized fibrinolytic-resistant pellet deposits. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Clotting pathologies in both acute COVID-19 infection and in Long COVID/PASC might benefit from following a regime of continued anticlotting therapy to support the fibrinolytic system function.",

Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is a common disorder, with possible psychosocial implications. Plastic surgeons have increased the practice of PRP injections for hair restoration. A meta-analysis on this topic was performed comparing local injection of PRP versus control to investigate the efficacy of local PRP injections in AGA. \n           \n           \n             Methods: \n             We performed a systematic literature search. The increase in number of hairs was the primary outcome.

    "document": "The Link Between Depression and Physical Symptoms\nPhysical symptoms are common in depression, and, in fact, vague aches and pain are often the presenting symptoms of depression. These symptoms include chronic joint pain, limb pain, back pain, gastrointestinal problems, tiredness, sleep disturbances, psychomotor activity changes, and appetite changes. A high percentage of patients with depression who seek treatment in a primary care setting report only physical symptoms, which can make depression very difficult to diagnose. Physical pain and depression have a deeper biological connection than simple cause and effect; the neurotransmitters that influence both pain and mood are serotonin and norepinephrine. Dysregulation of these transmitters is linked to both depression and pain. Antidepressants that inhibit the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine may be used as first-line treatments in depressed patients who present with physical symptoms. Many physicians consider patients to be in remission when their acute emotional symptoms have abated, but residual symptoms\u2014including physical symptoms\u2014are very common and increase the likelihood of relapse. All symptoms must be measured in order to achieve full remission. There are a number of short yet accurate measurement tools (rating scales) available that effectively measure the remission of physical symptoms as well as emotional symptoms.",

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the clotting disorder or the blood thinners, but I think it makes it harder for my body to metabolize bigger meals as well as larger amounts of carbs.\nThe only thing that has worked for me is eating 6 meals a day. 5 smaller meals of 100-150 cals each every 2-3 hours, and then a dinner with protein and vegetables. (Max of 1000 cals/day.) When I hit my goal weight, I bump it up until I start gaining weight. Usually to about 1500/day or 10,500 for the week.\nIf I have a longer way to go (like after quarantine..

My appetite has not increased while on SSRIs and I have been monitoring my calories.\n\nThe thyroid is fine and has been checked multiple times, my total testosterone level is normal, free testosterone and DHEA are high, had an ultrasound to check for PCOS however results of the scan were inconclusive and I don't fit the diagnostic criteria for PCOS otherwise, periods are regular.\n\nI have seen the endocrinologist today and he doesn't think it's PCOS and doesn't suspect any other hormone issue such as Cushing's etc. he thinks that starting antidepressants triggered weight gain and that even if I stopped taking them it wouldn't decrease my weight much and there is nothing we can do. He said I need to lose weight because I will be at high risk for other issues late in life but that the only thing I can do is have bariatric surgery and hope it works.\n\nI'm 21 and I take care of my health, i do everything right, I shouldn't need Bariatric surgery, I should be able to control my weight. I feel incredibly suicidal and want to die and if I can't fix my weight and figure out what's wrong I'm scared I might actually do it. This has been going on for years and I cant cope anymore, all I want is to be a healthy weight and not suicidal is that too much to ask?\n\nPlease help me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Blood Test results as requested are as such.\n\nTSH: 1.63 mIU/L (0.50-4.00)\n\nTotal Testosterone : 1.4 nmol/L (0.3-1.9)\n\nDehydroepiandrosterone Sulphate : 12.2 umol/L (4.0-10.0)\n\nSex Hormone Binding Globulin : 14 nmol/L (18-114)\n\nCalculated Free Testosterone : 38 pmol/L (4-32)\n\nGlucose(F) 4.8 mmol/L (4.0-6.0)\n\nHbA1c (New SI units) 36 mmol/mol ( 20-47)\n\n17 mIU/L Normal fasting serum insulin is between 3 and 25 mIU/L\n\nEdit: a few of the comments were questioning if my calorie estimation was accurate and I'm 100% sure it is. I have calorie tracked and dieted with a lot of guidance from multiple dietitians, I have a background in Medical science so I understand the science behind if you cut calories you lose weight, I believed this, I constantly feel ashamed and like all this is my fault because I'm weak and useless but I truly am eating a calorie deficit. I was eating approximately 1,500 calories a day for 6+ months. Also for 3 months, I was on the VLED diet which was so low it actually made my period irregular so I had to stop that.\n\nEdit: to the people in the comments I'm not part of the body positivity movement and if I'm honest I have a negative view of obesity due to my medical science degree I feel guilty enough I don't need to be shamed in the comments I am asking for compassionate medical advice.\n\nEdit: I live in Australia, not the UK or US, why do all the comments assume that \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: I am on SSRIs, not other drugs because weed or MNDA etc is illegal in Australia, I also have been in therapy for 5 years, seen 2 psychologists, a social worker and a psychiatrist nothing has helped besides the medication and despite my issues, I am the valedictorian for my faculty in university for my graduating year.",
    "document": "A comprehensive diagnostic approach to detect underlying causes of obesity in adults\nSummary \n           Obesity is a worldwide growing problem. When confronted with obesity, many health care providers focus on direct treatment of the consequences of adiposity. We plead for adequate diagnostics first, followed by an individualized treatment. We provide experience\u2010based and evidence\u2010based practical recommendations (illustrated by clinical examples), to detect potential underlying diseases and contributing factors. Adult patients consulting a doctor for weight gain or obesity should first be clinically assessed for underlying diseases, such as monogenetic or syndromic obesity, hypothyroidism, (cyclic) Cushing syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hypogonadism, growth hormone deficiency, and hypothalamic obesity. The most important alarm symptoms for genetic obesity are early onset obesity, dysmorphic features/congenital malformations with or without intellectual deficit, behavioral problems, hyperphagia, and/or striking family history. Importantly, also common contributing factors to weight gain should be investigated, including medication (mainly psychiatric drugs, (local) corticosteroids, insulin, and specific \u03b2\u2010adrenergic receptor blockers), sleeping habits and quality, crash diets and yoyo\u2010effect, smoking cessation, and alcoholism. Other associated conditions include mental factors such as chronic stress or binge\u2010eating disorder and depression.Identifying and optimizing the underlying diseases, contributing factors, and other associated conditions may not only result in more effective and personalized treatment but could also reduce the social stigma for patients with obesity.",
    "response": "What blood clotting disorder do you have?\n\nI have Protein S Deficiency and have struggled with weight gain as well. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the clotting disorder or the blood thinners, but I think it makes it harder for my body to metabolize bigger meals as well as larger amounts of carbs.\nThe only thing that has worked for me is eating 6 meals a day. 5 smaller meals of 100-150 cals each every 2-3 hours, and then a dinner with protein and vegetables. (Max of 1000 cals/day.) When I hit my goal weight, I bump it up until I start gaining weight. Usually to about 1500/day or 10,500 for the week.\nIf I have a longer way to go (like after quarantine.. I\u2019ll do 2 weeks of low cal, and then 1 week of 1500 to give myself a break.)\nI don\u2019t work out at all, or if I do, just walking the dog or swimming a few laps.\nFor the morning meals, I try to have some protein since it keeps me full longer. Things like cottage cheese, a low cal protein shake (Premier Protein caramel is bomb), low cal bread with cream cheese, everything bagel seasoning, and fruit.. salad with a few rotisserie chicken pieces & low cal dressing. \nDrink a ton of water too, like 60-100oz/day. \n\nThere may be something else going on and I\u2019d definitely take any advice here about following up with a specialist, but I hope that helps in the meantime! But most importantly, you are beautiful and worthy of a beautiful life. Don\u2019t cut that short by suicide or by being so hard on yourself that you can\u2019t enjoy it. Start practicing quiet time with yourself every day: journaling, meditation, prayer. Get outside in the sun. Go swimming once or twice a week. Pamper yourself. And start taking a multivitamin as well if you aren\u2019t already. And if you have a celebration, a birthday, anniversary, etc.. go celebrate and jump back into weight loss the next day. \ud83d\udc95\n\nEditing to add: I have been able to reliably lose about 10lbs a month following that diet when I need to, even with eating out or cheating occasionally. Hoping it is just the blood thinners messing with our metabolism and that it works for you too!"

    "question": "I'm a 25 year old white male living in the United States and my adult height is 5 ft 2, a little less than the 1st percentile for an adult male.  Even though i'm very short, what's even more unusual is that I actually come from a relatively tall all-white family. Both of my grandfathers were 6 ft or taller along with my uncle, and many of the cousins on both sides of the family.  My grandmothers are average height along with my mom and dad who are 5 ft 5 and 5 ft 10 respectively.  Nobody in my family is significantly shorter than average, i'm the only one.  I was not malnourished as a kid either, I live in a upper-middle class family.   \n\n\nI was always shorter than average as a kid; probably around the 5th of 10th percentile. Mom took me to an endocrinologist when I was 10 years old and my bone age came back the same as my biological age so the doctors decided not to give me any treatment thinking that I was going to grow later in life. This later turned out to be a big mistake.   \n\n\nI started puberty relatively early. At 10 years old, my voice was already starting to crack. When I entered 6th grade, I was one of the few kids whos voice was starting to lower. Some of the kids even noticed I had a tiny mustache, which they found odd.   I did the majority of my growth in 6th and 7th grade but only grew a half inch around 14. I also took adderall throughout my early childhood including all of my 8th grade year and half of my 9th grade year. At the age of 15, my mom was concerned that I had hardly grown in the past year so she took me to an endocrinologist. I had a bone age scan done and the doctors told me I had a bone age of 17, two years advanced, and that I wasn't going to get any taller.  I was only 5 ft 2.   \n\n\nSo I have several questions that I don't know if they can be answered.  Why and how did I wind up much shorter than average?  Is there an explanation?   Why did I have short stature and an advanced bone age?  Are there anything sort of genetics mutations that could have caused this?   \n\n\n  \n*tldr version.  I'm a 5 ft 2 male despite coming from a tall white upper middle class family.  My bone age was 2 years advanced and I took adderal and vyvance as a kid.  I want to know why I wound up much shorter than average.*\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nHere\u2019s a list of my family and their respective heights. \n\n\nMe: 5 ft 2 male.\n\nMom: 5 ft 5\n\nDad: 5 ft 10\n\nMaternal Grandma: 5 ft 3\n\nMaternal Grandpa: 6 ft\n\nPaternal Grandma: 5 ft 5\n\nPaternal Grandpa: 6 ft 3.\n\nPaternal Uncle: 6 ft 1\n\nPaternal cousins (men): 6 ft and 6 ft 2 respectively\n\nPaternal cousin (woman):  5 ft 8\n\nMaternal aunt: 5 ft 10\n\nMaternal uncle: 6 ft tall\n\nMaternal cousins (men):  5 ft 10 and 6 ft 3.\n\nMaternal cousins (women): 5 ft 8 and 5 ft 9.\n\nThere are no men under 5 ft 9 in my family, and there are a few women who are slightly below average.

It is concluded that, while these medications have a favorable benefit/risk profile and do not induce clinically significant changes in growth or cardiovascular function in the large majority of cases, careful patient monitoring is needed to identify individuals at risk for negative outcomes. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of growth suppression better estimate the risk for rare but life-threatening events, and test the effectiveness of monitoring procedures.",
    "response": "Hi, pediatric endocrinologist in training here. There is not always an explanation to be found in situations like this; while we can give an approximate prediction of range of expected final heights of children born to a given set of parents, there is a small percentage of normal individuals who will fall outside of this range. \n\nI don't think the doctors who saw you when you were younger made a mistake, as you commented - at that time, it sounds like you probably had mild short stature for family but did not meet the medical criteria for providing growth hormone for idiopathic short stature at that age (since your height was 5th-10th %ile at that time, and only later on did it fall to a lower percentile). \n\nTo your question of whether genetic mutations could play a role, that's always a possibility. We are continuing to learn a lot about genetic variants that impact height, and if an individual has what's known as a \"de novo\" mutation in a growth gene (ie, not inherited from a parent), they could have a final height discrepant from that expected for their family. One example of such a gene, which can cause short stature with advanced bone age, is the aggrecan gene (ACAN). There are a very few genetic syndromes (Turner syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, Noonan syndrome being a few which have other diagnostic criteria that an otherwise healthy person such as yourself wouldn't meet) that are in and of themselves indications for using growth hormone; otherwise, it is impossible as of now to test for all genes that could impact growth, and the decision to start GH is still based on auxological (ie, growth-based) criteria in most cases.\n\nI don't know if any of this information is helpful to you. However, it doesn't sound like your family or doctors did anything wrong, and I don't think there's anything you or they need to feed badly about. Best wishes to you and take care!"

    "document": "Bisphenol A Exposure Disrupts Organelle Distribution and Functions During Mouse Oocyte Maturation\nBisphenol A (BPA) is one of the ubiquitous environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs). Previous studies have shown that the reproduction toxicity of BPA could cause severe effects on the mammal oocytes and disturb the quality of mature oocytes. However, the toxic effects of BPA on the organelles of mouse oocytes have not been reported. In this study, to investigate whether BPA can be toxic to the organelles, we used different concentrations of BPA (50, 100, and 200 \u03bcM) to culture mouse oocytes  in vitro . The results showed that 100 \u03bcM BPA exposure could significantly decrease the developmental capacity of oocytes. Then, we used the immunofluorescence staining, confocal microscopy, and western blotting to investigate the toxic effects of BPA on the organelles. The results revealed that mitochondrial dysfunction is manifested by abnormal distribution and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Moreover, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is abnormally distributed which is accompanied by ER stress showing increased expression of GRP78. For the Golgi apparatus, BPA-exposed dose not disorder the Golgi apparatus distribution but caused abnormal structure of Golgi apparatus, which is manifested by the decrease of GM130 protein expression. Moreover, we also found that BPA-exposed led to the damage of lysosome, which were shown by the increase of LAMP2 protein expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that the exposure of BPA could damage the normal function of the organelles, which may explain the reduced maturation quality of oocytes.",
    "response": "I'm going to post my hymen rant here to give you a little more information about the hymen in general, so please read below. I'm also going to give you a little more background on your situation. It is very unlikely that the hymen is causing you any pain. However, anxiety, stress, and fear about your vaginal opening are likely causing you discomfort which can result in vulvodynia (pain around the vulva) or vaginismus (painful muscular spasms when you try to insert things). You may also need to work a little bit to get comfortable stretching your hymen for insertion. If in doubt about physical ability to insert larger objects, you can see a gynecologist or family doctor, who can do an exam and make sure everything looks normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven in medical communities I see references to the hymen being analogous to the protective film on an iPad when you buy one, and I want to clear up some common myths and misconceptions about the hymen. \n\nThe hymen is not a magical freshness seal over the vagina that many people think it is. The hymen is a [thin rim of stretchy tissue (NSFW)]( that surrounds (but doesn't usually obstruct) the entrance to the vagina. [Another NSFW image]( And [another]( These are considered \"intact\" hymen, showing no obvious tears or damage. Some women have very little noticeable hymen, and some are born without one at all. I know what you're thinking, \"If it's not a virginity freshness seal, what the hell is it for?\" Great question! It's thought that the hymen may serve its purpose early in life, providing an extra tissue barrier to prevent fecal bacteria from getting into the vagina during infancy and childhood. \n\nIn children the hymen is a thicker and less flexible ring, and may (or may not) obstruct more of the opening of the vagina (again, not generally covering it completely). As it is less flexible in childhood, trauma to the vaginal area through sports, gymnastics, horseback riding, and other normal activities can damage the hymen early in life, and even sometimes later in adolescence or adulthood, but less often. These tears may heal completely, or result in \"notching\" of the tissue. This is a super NSFW medical photo of a young person who experienced sexual assault and trauma to the hymen resulting in [notching]( This doesn't always cause visible damage, but in this case, pretty severe tearing occurred. It's also worth noting that the sports and activities I mentioned are more likely than others to cause hymenal damage, but usually don't. (A good friend of mine was quite surprised at a recent ob/gyn visit to discover she had an intact hymen at ~24 years of age, having been a competitive horseback rider since she was a small child.)\n\nDuring adolescence the hymen thins out and becomes very flexible and stretchy, and will actually stretch really well during arousal and when lubricated, so there is NO NEED in like 90% of women for the hymen to tear during sex, even the first time! There are certain variations that can be problematic for sexual activity and general health ([for example, imperforate hymens are medically dangerous and result in an inability to have penetration AND a buildup of menses, and semi-imperforate or cribriform hymen may allow menses but won't allow penetration, these hymen require either tearing or a quick ob/gyn visit to fix]( However, more than 90% of women do not have these variations. A lot of this wasn't even known until a series of studies in the 1980's found that about 20% of sexually active women had \"intact\" hymens with no signs of notching or tearing. A report by physicians who [evaluated children and women who were vaginally assaulted noted that a lack of specific hymenal damage in the assault was actually quite common,]( especially in adult women and adolescents, and suggested to the public that tearing the hymen was not the necessity for sex that many people think it is. A more recent study in 2004 found that [52% of sexually active women had no hymenal notching or clefts.]( In several studies afterward there was also found to be [no statistically significant association between tampon use and visible hymenal tears,]( however it is thought that using tampons can sometimes cause tears. (I mean who is actually aroused and comfortable when inserting a tampon, right?)\n\nIt's common for people to believe the myth that the hymen must tear the first time, and for young inexperienced people to have sex without proper arousal, lubrication, and communication that results in hymen tearing. In fact, the expectation of pain often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, with women too nervous to be aroused properly, and unwilling to stop and slow down their partners when something hurts. \n\nYou might be thinking \"well this is some liberal bullshit propaganda if I've ever heard any\", but if that's your thought, [check out this super biased religious journal article regarding the hymen]( which actually confirms most of this, and adds some interesting tidbits, for example the fact that elephants have been noted to have hymens as well, and these don't tear with sex, but only with childbirth. \n\nI hope this helps to explain the hymen a bit better, and clears up any misconceptions you might have."

Please read the timeline below and see if you have ANY clues/ideas.\n\nRelevant background information: The weather is currently cold enough to have heaters on, around 40 degrees F. This is in the southeast United States.\n\n**Monday, 11/8:** Lexi goes to school as normal, feeling fine. Mid-morning, she leaves a voicemail with her mom saying her chest hurts and she feels very bad. She asks for her mom to pick her up. Hearing the voicemail later, and not having heard from the teacher about anything being wrong, her mom decides to let her finish the day at school. When she arrives home from school, her lips are a deep purple shade when she removes her mask. She is in good spirits, plays outside, and does not complain of anything being wrong. Her mom assumes that she was cold at school, and does not connect the earlier voicemail to anything at this time. She wonders if it may be coloring rubbed off from a mask, or perhaps an allergy to something inside the mask? Doesn't give it much more thought.\n\n**Tuesday, 11/9:** Lexi returns to school, having been fine all evening/morning. When she comes home from school, her lips are an even darker shade of purple. She claims that she feels just fine, and plays outside all evening ... but her mom is concerned and checks her oxygen. It's lower than it should be (I do not have this reading). Her mom hovers over her all night and checks her breathing, nothing unusual. At this point, she is connecting the chest pain from the day before to the lip discoloration, and is alarmed.\n\n**Wednesday, 11/10:** Her mom brings her to the doctor, who does blood work but doesn't think anything odd is happening (thinks the lip coloring is due to the cold because Lexi is behaving just fine).  Then the carboxyhemoglobin levels come back, and they are higher than they should be, at a 2. The doctor calls her, and says she has carbon monoxide poisoning. He says he needs to notify health authorities about this, and asks them to have their home tested. At this point, Lexi has only been to school and home. There are 4 other children who live in the home, and both parents were home all day Monday/Tuesday. Plus, they have carbon monoxide detectors ... so they are fairly sure that nothing is going on there. Plus, if you recall from earlier, Lexi was improving at home and experiencing issues while at school. Nonetheless, they call the fire department, who comes out. The readings confirm the home is fine, 0 ppm. They reach out to Lexi's school.\n\n**Thursday - Monday, 11/11 - 11/15:** The school commits to have a carbon monoxide test performed on Monday morning, before the school opens, as they were closed Thursday and Friday for the long weekend. Friday, Lexi is re-tested. Her carboxyhemoglobin remains elevated, at a 2. The doctor is surprised that it has **not** gone down since her initial reading, as she has been away from school and has not since been symptomatic. He remarks that her blood has the same carboxyhemoglobin value as a smoker (which she is not). She has 1 family member who smokes, but not near her, and she is not with that person full-time. \n\nThe school is tested on Monday morning (it is important to note that 4 days had passed since anybody was in the school, due to the Veterans Day holiday weekend, and the heater presumably had been off). The test shows 0 ppm. The school does not have any other students who had the same issue. The school is tentatively ruled out as a potential source.\n\nBut now - what? Lexi had not been around any buses, exhausts, outdoor heaters.. she had only been to school and back. Her mom is at a loss for what to think and wonders if it may have been due to some underlying issue. The chest pain in particular is scary, and her doctor has no further suggestions as to how this could have happened.\n\nYour thoughts are appreciated.",
    "document": "The Role of Methemoglobin and Carboxyhemoglobin in COVID-19: A Review\nFollowing the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) associated with pneumonia in China (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) at the end of 2019, the world is currently facing a global pandemic of infections with SARS-CoV-2 and cases of COVID-19. Since severely ill patients often show elevated methemoglobin (MetHb) and carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) concentrations in their blood as a marker of disease severity, we aimed to summarize the currently available published study results (case reports and cross-sectional studies) on MetHb and COHb concentrations in the blood of COVID-19 patients. To this end, a systematic literature research was performed. For the case of MetHb, seven publications were identified (five case reports and two cross-sectional studies), and for the case of COHb, three studies were found (two cross-sectional studies and one case report). The findings reported in the publications show that an increase in MetHb and COHb can happen in COVID-19 patients, especially in critically ill ones, and that MetHb and COHb can increase to dangerously high levels during the course of the disease in some patients. The medications given to the patient and the patient\u2019s glucose-6-phospate dehydrogenase (G6PD) status seem to be important factors determining the severity of the methemoglobinemia and carboxyhemoglobinemia. Therefore, G6PD status should be determined before medications such as hydroxychloroquine are administered. In conclusion, MetHb and COHb can be elevated in COVID-19 patients and should be checked routinely in order to provide adequate medical treatment as well as to avoid misinterpretation of fingertip pulse oximetry readings, which can be inaccurate and unreliable in case of elevated MetHb and COHb levels in the blood.",

A literature review was conducted using the US National Institute of Health\u2019s PubMed service (including Medline), Google Scholar and Scopus. Guidelines provided by the World Health Organization, Safe Injection Global Network, International Council of Nursing, Center for Disease Control, US Federal Drug Agency, UK National Health Services, British Medical Association, Europe Nursing and Midwifery Council, Public Health Agency Canada, Pakistan Medical Association and International Organization of Standardization recommendations 7886 parts 1-4 for sterile hypodermics were reviewed for relevant information. In addition, curricula of several medical/nursing schools from India, Nigeria and Pakistan, the US pharmacopeia Data from the WHO Program for International Drug Monitoring network in regard to adverse events as a result of not aspirating prior to injection delivery were reviewed. Curricula of selected major medical/nursing schools in India, Nigeria and Pakistan, national therapeutic formularies, product inserts of most commonly used drugs and other possible sources of information regarding aspiration and injections were consulted as well.",
    "response": "There aren't any major blood vessels in the area where we give vaccines. Aspiration isn't necessary and makes the process of giving the vaccine more complicated."

    "question": "My husband 37M, Atlanta,GA, early onset parkinsons and history of sinus issues, was tested for covid-19 on 3/16. We got the results on 3/28 from the ER saying they were positive. He called his PCP on Monday requesting a doctors note from work as they were requesting one. His doctor got the results back from the ER and they say inconclusive, not positive. So now his PCP is wanting to release him back to work tomorrow? Even though he is still VERY short of breath, running a low grade fever, coughing, and incredibly exhausted. He\u2019s an \u201cessential employee\u201d (works at a car dealership so that\u2019s apparently essential \ud83d\ude44). His doctors office doesn\u2019t want him to come in, but wants him to go back to work because he has no diagnosis. \n\n\nOh but they think it\u2019s somehow sinusitis because he has a history of that? Um. What? Since when does sinusitis cause you to be unable to catch your breath?! But then they go on to say lots of false negatives out there and that he should go back to the ER. I think the fuck not. Every single ER would be PISSED he came in because he is NOT in an emergent need. He\u2019s ok. He\u2019s just not ok to go back to work and if he has covid-19, then he is VERY much so contagious. What do we do here?!?",

    "document": "Comparing the Real-World Effectiveness of Competing Colonoscopy\nPreparations: Results of a Prospective Trial\nOBJECTIVES: \n             Despite the importance of adequate bowel cleansing prior to\ncolonoscopy, national societies provide little guidance regarding which\nbowel preps are best tolerated and most effective; this reflects a lack of\ncomparative effectiveness studies that directly evaluate available preps in\na \u201creal-world\u201d setting. To address this gap, we conducted a\nprospective, naturalistic, commercially unfunded, comparative effectiveness\nstudy of currently available bowel preps and measured their impact on bowel\ncleansing. \n           \n           \n             METHODS: \n             We included patients \u226518 years old who presented for an\noutpatient colonoscopy at a large medical center serving >70 academic\nand community-based endoscopists who are free to prescribe the bowel prep of\ntheir choice. The primary outcome was bowel cleansing quality as measured by\nthe Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). The secondary outcome was prep\ntolerability. We performed regression models with random effects on the\noutcomes to adjust for confounding. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS: \n             There were 4339 colonoscopies performed by 75 endoscopists.\nMagnesium citrate, Miralax\u00ae with Gatorade\u00ae, Moviprep\u00ae,\nOsmoprep\u00ae, Prepopik\u00ae/Clenpiq\u00ae, and Suprep\u00ae all\nhad significantly higher prep tolerability compared to GoLYTELY\u00ae (all\np<.05).

    "response": ">(this time pills + water), and mag citrate\n\nDo you mean dulcolax pills with magnesium citrate? That's fairly standard bowel prep. \n\nThe first prep depends on what combination of the two he recommended. If it was a full 4L of PEG + magnesium citrate, it is probably on the aggressive side for prep but honestly it's better than a poor prep.\n\n Standard prep is something like 4L PEG +/- a couple dulcolax pills or 2 bottles of magnesium citrate +/- dulcolax pills. Some of the commercial products that are needlessly hundreds of dollars tries to simplify that by reducing the overall volume (or taste) but essentially the amount that goes through you is probably around 4L eventually."

    "document": "Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome\nCoinciding with the increasing rates of cannabis abuse has been the recognition of a new clinical condition known as Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, and frequent hot bathing. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome occurs by an unknown mechanism. Despite the well-established anti-emetic properties of marijuana, there is increasing evidence of its paradoxical effects on the gastrointestinal tract and CNS. Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabigerol are three cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant with opposing effects on the emesis response. The clinical course of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome may be divided into three phases: prodromal, hyperemetic, and recovery phase. The hyperemetic phase usually ceases within 48 hours, and treatment involves supportive therapy with fluid resuscitation and anti-emetic medications. Patients often demonstrate the learned behavior of frequent hot bathing, which produces temporary cessation of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The broad differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting often leads to delay in the diagnosis of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome shares several similarities with CHS and the two conditions are often confused. Knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and natural course of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is limited and requires further investigation.",

However, sporadic cases of disease recurrence suggest that in some cases the procedure itself may contribute to this complication. This article reviews evidence relating to needle biopsy of the breast and the potential for tumour cell migration into adjacent tissues following the procedure. A literature search was undertaken using Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library. Results are grouped under three categories: histological evidence of spread, clinical evidence of recurrent disease and the likelihood of seeding dependent upon tumour type. There is histological evidence of seeding of tumour cells from the primary neoplastic site into adjacent breast tissue following biopsy. However, as the interval between biopsy and surgery lengthens then the incidence of seeding declines, which suggests that displaced tumour cells are not viable. Clinical recurrence at the site of a needle biopsy is uncommon and the relationship between biopsy and later recurrence is difficult to confirm. There is some evidence to suggest that cell seeding may be reduced when vacuum biopsy devices are deployed.",

Functional magnetic resonance brain images were acquired for 50\u2009minutes interprandially. Intravenous infusion of erythromycin (40\u2009mg) or saline started 10\u2009minutes after the start of scanning. Blood samples (for glucose and hormone levels) and hunger ratings were collected at fixed timepoints. Thirteen volunteers completed the study, without any adverse events.

The route of vaccination appeared to be important for the protective activity of the ribosomal vaccine. Optimal protection was measured if both the immunizing and the challenge injection were given intraperitoneally. The ribosomal vaccine protected mice as early as 1 day after vaccination, and the protection lasted at least 6 days. LPS-specific antibodies were detectable 6 but not 2 days after vaccination. The ribosomal vaccine protected mice also against a heterologous serotype of  Pseudomonas.  Injection of purified LPS did not protect mice earlier than at day 3, and the protection induced by LPS was serotype specific. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) isolated from the ribosomal vaccine had the same protective properties as the ribosomes. RNA induced serotype-nonspecific protection as quickly as 1 day after injection, and the protection lasted at least 6 days. However, the capacity to induce antibodies to LPS was lost or reduced. It is concluded that the serotype-nonspecific protection induced by RNA and the serotype-specific protection induced by LPS are due to different mechanisms. Experiments with combined vaccines containing RNA and LPS demonstrated that the addition of RNA to LPS resulted in a slight increase in LPS-specific antibodies. The data presented indicate that both the serotype-specific protection induced by LPS and the serotype-nonspecific protection induced by RNA contribute to the protective activity of the ribosomal vaccine.",

Urgent referral to a regional specialist may improve the opportunity for thrombolysis to restore blood flow through the subclavian vein and to decrease the chance of pulmonary embolus, recurrent thrombosis, or need for vein grafting, as well as to improve the time to return to full activity (athletics and/or manual labor).",

However, in a young, healthy, active male, it's uncommon for a DVT to occur. Even more uncommon is a DVT in the arm instead of the leg. HOWEVER, there is a condition called [Paget-Schroetter Syndrome]( which involves a DVT formed by compression of the axillo-subclavian vein during exercise. Common things being common, it might be this. This is not a dangerous condition, but it does require evaluation.\n\nIf you take a peek at the linked article and find that the symptoms described are very similar to yours, you need an ultrasound/PVL to evaluate. If you really feel the need, you can go to the ER for that, but that's expensive. Your best bet is to call in to your doctor, describe your symptoms, mention DVT or Paget-Schroetter Syndrome, and ask for an ultrasound ASAP. PSS is very manageable and curable in the acute setting, but you might have to get a rib resection in the future. Keep in mind that this is all pertaining to PSS; it might just be a simple DVT.\n\nTL;DR: Call your doctor, request an ultrasound within the next 2 weeks to evaluate for a DVT or Paget-Schroetter Syndrome.

    "document": "Gastroesophageal Reflux Therapy Is Associated with Longer Survival in Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis\nRationale : Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is highly prevalent in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Chronic microaspiration secondary to GER may play a role in the pathogenesis and natural history of IPF. \n           Objectives : To investigate the relationship between GER-related variables and survival time in patients with IPF. \n           Methods : Regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between GER-related variables and survival time in a retrospectively identified cohort of patients with well-characterized IPF from two academic medical centers. \n           Measurements and Main Results : Two hundred four patients were identified for inclusion. GER-related variables were common in this cohort: reported symptoms of GER (34%), a history of GER disease (45%), reported use of GER medications (47%), and Nissen fundoplication (5%). These GER-related variables were significantly associated with longer survival time on unadjusted analysis. After adjustment, the use of GER medications was an independent predictor of longer survival time. In addition, the use of gastroesophageal reflux medications was associated with a lower radiologic fibrosis score. These findings were present regardless of center. \n           Conclusions : The reported use of GER medications is associated with decreased radiologic fibrosis and is an independent predictor of longer survival time in patients with IPF. These findings further support the hypothesis that GER and chronic microaspiration may play important roles in the pathobiology of IPF.",

    "document": "Does Chronic Microaspiration Cause Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a diffuse fibrotic lung disease of unknown etiology with no effective treatment. Emerging data support a role for chronic microaspiration (i.e. subclinical aspiration of small droplets) in the pathogenesis and natural history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, the precise relationship between chronic microaspiration and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis remains unknown. Gastroesophageal reflux, a presumed risk factor for microaspiration, has been strongly associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with an estimated prevalence of 90%. This review aims to describe the relationship between chronic microaspiration and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by laying out the clinical and biologic rationale for this relationship and exploring the scientific evidence available. The gaps in our current understanding of the diagnosis of chronic microaspiration and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the ongoing uncertainties in management and treatment will be highlighted. Defining the role of chronic microaspiration in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is essential as it has potential clinical, pathobiological and treatment implications for this deadly disease.",

    "document": "Serotonin Syndrome: Pathophysiology, Clinical Features, Management, and Potential Future Directions\nSerotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A  and 5-HT 2A  subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

    "question": "\\*\\*Edit 2 (August 8) -- \n\nOn July 26th I drove her to Austin to see a pedi cardiologist associated with Dell Children's Hospital. For starters, their nurse got the same measurement for height that I did at home, which is 39 inches, which is SMALLER than what her pedis nurse got, meaning she measured her incorrectly and her growth chart is skewed. The cardio gave her a good exam and did an EKG, said he doesn't believe it's a cardio related issue but that he does think it's vascular. I believe the term he used was vascular congestion. He said he's never seen it before, but that he's also never seen an older child with this issue so he believes she will grow out of it. At first he tried to tell me she was probably dehydrated to which my response was \"She drinks almost exclusively water, and here's a blood test showing she's not dehydrated\". Overall, since the episodes aren't causing pain/tissue damage right now, he doesn't want to medicate her but if it does start to cause more issues we will get into it then. He also mentioned that if it gets worse or if I just believe it's time we can see a vascular surgeon to look further into it. He said he did hear a very tiny murmur but that he 100% did not believe it was causing a single issue and that it was ok.\n\nSemi-related - I spoke with her pedi the week before and asked for a referral to a pedi cardio...and she refused to give me one because she didn't believe we needed it. I got very frustrated at that because 1) what is she losing by giving me a referral when she clearly doesn't know what to do about the issue at hand? 2) Why are you stopping someone from advocating for their child? We've been dealing with the issue for over 3 years at this point, she's been treating it for a little over 2 years, and it's still happening.\n\nSo, I said fuck it, called damn near every pedi cardiologist in Tx and found someone that would take us without a referral since our insurance doesn't require one. I'm pretty sure I sounded like a crazy mom but, I'm not going to stop advocating for my child. The cardiologist we did see agreed that she DID need to be seen again and it was good I brought her in.\n\nSo, still no for sure answers but I'm happy with what we got and I feel like it's a start in the right direction.\n\n\\*\\*Edit 1 --\n\nI got my daughter in with her doc today and really went for it. Came out of it with mostly good news and no bad news.\n\nIn my OP I posted that this week I took my measurements of her and she was only 40 inches, their measurements today varied --\n\nWeight - 38 lb 3.2oz (42nd percentile)  \nHeight - Her nurse measured her at 3' 4.75\" (21st percentile, up from 10th percentile she was at in September of last year). However, myself and the cardiologist we would visit after this appointment found this measurement to be incorrect and found her to still be at 39inches.\n\nDoc said she is happy with that, I can be happy with that too.\n\nWe talked about labs and I asked for a TON that were suggested here and we talked about each one. We compromised with CBC/Differential, Celiac (which will take a few more days to come back), ferritin, Iron/TIBC, Sedementation Rate (ESR), and a urinalysis because over the last 2 weeks she's had 2 accidents where she didn't make it to the toilet in time but was right in front of it. Urinalysis allowed us to test for a UTI and for glucose/other in the urine.\n\nLabs show she is no longer iron deficient which is GREAT, however, we still don't know why she turns blue. She's going to look into how to test for Raynauds and see if it's something she can do. She didn't want to do an ANA just yet because I guess Rheumatologists in the area are real persnickety about them doing it so we compromised and did the ESR to see if there was any inflammation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is really long, and really in depth, but someone PLEASE take the time to read it and tell me why mt 4f daughter isn't growing like she should, has extremeties that turn blue, and why NO ONE can tell me what is wrong with her aside from \"well that's odd\". Seriously, my mom gut on this one, I KNOW it's something and I don't know what else to fight for. I won't let my kid fall between the cracks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBorn August 2, 2016.\n\nHealthy pregnancy, had extra fluid for a few weeks but it resolved on its own.\n\nVaginal delivery, cord was wrapped around her legs but caused no problems, 7lb 2oz, apgar 8 & 9. Right ear failed newborn hearing test, passed at audiologist a week or so later. Bilirubin was a little high \u201c5.5 transcutaneously\u201d, sent home with vitamin D drops.\n\nShe always LOVED to be warm. Like fleece footie jammies and a blanket while cuddling with someone. I'm always cold so I didn't think much of it.\n\nWhen she was a little over 1 I started noticing odd stuff. May 2 2018 she was sitting in her high chair, shirt and shorts, A/C was on around 74 and she's holding a cup of milk in her hands and her fingers, hands, feet, lips turn BLUE. Not choking/coughing/etc, just sitting there watching tv and drinking her milk. It goes away a few minutes later.\n\nI took her to our base ER where they did a chest xray - normal, vitals, normal.\n\nThey transferred us to a children's ER across town that did blood work and referred us to a cardiologist. ER discharge papers show diagnosis as \u201cacrocyanosis. Children often will grow out of it. There are other causes of acrocyanosis that would require further tests if the bluish color continues. These can be connective tissues disorders or autoimmune disorders.\u201d\n\nBlood work - her results, then lab ranges\n\nChloride - 108 high (no lab range)\n\nCreatinine - 0.26 low (no lab range)\n\nPLT count - 472K/mm3 (150-450)\n\nBaso - 0.1 K/mm3 (0.01-0.6)\n\nCardiologist does an echo, totally normal, great!! She was mildly cyanotic early that morning.\n\nJune 8th - Mild cyanosis in late morning, her cap refill was 10seconds. SP02 - 80, BPM 87\n\nJune 14th - Mild cyanosis late afternoon, hands and toes. 8 sec cap refill, house 74 degrees, fully dressed, running/playing/drinking\n\nBase referred us to a pediatric rheumatologist in the city, \"she'll grow out of it, her metabolism needs to mature\".\n\nOk, I've had a number of docs and specialists tell me she's fine, we'll let it go for a while.\n\nIt keeps happening, though eventually it does lessen in frequency, I stop thinking about it for a while (for the sake of my sanity). We move to Texas in 2019, start seeing regular, non-military physicians.\n\nOver time I notice her finger and toenails stop growing. No, not slow, STOP. I did not clip her nails for over a year. They are brittle, ribbed, etc, her doc runs a blood test, low iron, start her on flintsone vitamins with extra iron, it helps, cool.

    "document": "Biological relevance of ZNF224 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication IN NF-kB pathway regulation\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, whose presentation and clinical course are highly variable. Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",
    "response": "I agree that something is definitely going on. I\u2019m really concerned about the drop in her growth (both weight and height), and that plus the nail changes makes me concerned for something that\u2019s interfering with her absorption of nutrients.\n\nI would really push the growth failure with her doctors - the fingers turning blue is strange but someone might write it off as \u201cweird but not imminently threatening\u201d, as has sort of happened to date, while crossing tons of percentiles on the growth chart should raise big red flags for something that needs to be addressed now.\n\nIf you\u2019re getting brushed off seek a second opinion, ideally at a big children\u2019s hospital. I would probably want to do a workup to investigate/exclude things like CF, autoimmune conditions affecting absorption (like celiac), a congenital heart defect that was somehow missed (due to the cyanosis), rheumatological conditions (because the fingers turning blue could be raynauds), etc.\n\nEdit: okay some of this is probably ruled out by the previous workup (I missed that there was an echo the first time), but I still think pushing the growth issues is the best way forward rn."

    "document": "The Relationship of Caffeine Intake with Depression, Anxiety, Stress, and Sleep in Korean Adolescents\nBackground \n             In various studies in adults, caffeine may increase wakefulness and relieve pain, but caffeine overdose can cause many adverse serious effects on health. Caffeine intake has recently been increasing in adolescents. In spite of importance of caffeine effects on Korean adolescents, there are lack of scientific and systematic studies. The purpose of our study was to identify the relationship between caffeine consumption and effects on adolescents. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We performed study on 234 middle school students at one middle school in Daegu using a self-report questionnaire. We divided students to quartiles according to amount of caffeine intake. We used Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to evaluate the degree of depression and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) to evaluate the degree of anxiety. We also used Insomnia Severity Scale (ISI) to evaluate the degree of insomnia and Global Assessment of Recent Stress (GARS) to evaluate the stress in students.

She weighs 34 lbs. She keeps losing weight but only a little at a time (like a few ounces here and there). She weighed 39 lbs about three months ago. We've noticed that she has been bruising easier and barely eats. I called her doctor about a month ago and asked what I could do at home because I didn't want to take her into a doctor's office during the pandemic. They recommended pediasure. She loves it and thinks it's chocolate milk but that's all she wants at dinner. She has severe ADHD so that is why she is on Vyvanse and Methylin. We are concerned she is losing too much weight. I called her pediatrician and waiting for a call back from them. Any other advice or suggestions? Thank you for your help! \n\n[Photo of bruising](\n\nEDIT: I am not here to be judged.

    "document": "The Complicated Relationship Between Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Substance Use Disorders\nAdolescents and young adults with substance use disorders (SUD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are increasingly presenting in clinical practice. The overlap and role of treatment for these co-occurring disorders remains unclear. A review of the literature was conducted to highlight and update recent evidence on the overlap of ADHD and SUD, the role of ADHD medication on later SUD, and the treatment of ADHD and SUD in adolescents and young adults. Recent work continues to highlight the high risk for comorbid ADHD in patients with SUD; and conversely, the high risk for SUD developing in ADHD across the lifespan, particularly in the context of comorbid conduct disorder. Although the data remains discordant, it appears that ADHD pharmacotherapy does not increase the risk for SUD. Medication treatment alone does not appear to be particularly effective in treating SUD in currently active substance abusing individuals with ADHD. Structured therapies may be effective in treating adolescents and young adults with ADHD and SUD. Further controlled trials evaluating the sequence and effect of structured psychotherapies and/or ADHD pharmacotherapy on SUD relapse in these groups are warranted.",
    "response": "Hi, family resident here. I would definitely take her in to see her family doctor or paediatrician for assessment and for bloodwork. Children with ADHD often have bruises and scrapes from injuries they aren\u2019t paying attention to and vyvanse could certainly decrease her appetite. That being said, poor weight gain is concerning in children and weight loss even more so. There\u2019s a long list of causes for thrombocytopenia (low platelets) or platelet dysfunction (sometimes the cause of easy bruising) and this includes hematologic malignancies and clotting disorders (like von Willebrand disease). Hemophilias/coagulopathies are still definitely in the differential but are more often associated with deep bleeding while platelet disorders typically present with superficial bruising. Another less likely possibility is malnutrition from decreased appetite leading to inadequate vitamin K and thus poor clotting function. Regardless, these things should be ruled out. After reading some of the comments, I would like to mention that ITP requires a thorough work up to rule out other causes of thrombocytopenia and isn\u2019t really something that you would just diagnose on presentation. Lastly, you should consider pausing the vyvanse, reducing the dose, or trying a medication like concerta (scheduled dosing instead of methylphenidate prn). Again, chat with her fam doc for this.\n\nTLDR: see your family doctor/paediatrician to rule out thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, and coagulopathies. Weight loss in children is not good. Change or pause the vyvanse.\n\nEdit: spelling error, clarifying regular concerta/methylphenidate instead of prn"

    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

    "document": "The effect of daily caffeine use on cerebral blood flow: How much caffeine can we tolerate?\nAbstract \n           Caffeine is a commonly used neurostimulant that also produces cerebral vasoconstriction by antagonizing adenosine receptors. Chronic caffeine use results in an adaptation of the vascular adenosine receptor system presumably to compensate for the vasoconstrictive effects of caffeine. We investigated the effects of caffeine on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in increasing levels of chronic caffeine use. Low (mean = 45 mg/day), moderate (mean = 405 mg/day), and high (mean = 950 mg/day) caffeine users underwent quantitative perfusion magnetic resonance imaging on four separate occasions: twice in a caffeine abstinent state (abstained state) and twice in a caffeinated state following their normal caffeine use (native state). In each state, there were two drug conditions: participants received either caffeine (250 mg) or placebo. Gray matter CBF was tested with repeated\u2010measures analysis of variance using caffeine use as a between\u2010subjects factor, and correlational analyses were conducted between CBF and caffeine use. Caffeine reduced CBF by an average of 27% across both caffeine states. In the abstained placebo condition, moderate and high users had similarly greater CBF than low users; but in the native placebo condition, the high users had a trend towards less CBF than the low and moderate users. Our results suggest a limited ability of the cerebrovascular adenosine system to compensate for high amounts of daily caffeine use. Hum Brain Mapp 2009. \u00a9 2009 Wiley\u2010Liss, Inc.",

    "document": "Hyaluronic Acid Derivative Molecular Weight-Dependent Synthesis and Antimicrobial Effect of Hybrid Silver Nanoparticles\nSilver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) appeared as promising antimicrobial candidates to face the development of antibiotic resistance. Although reported as toxic towards mammalian cells, their combination with biomolecules have shown reduced toxicity, while maintaining the antimicrobial function. Herein, hyaluronic acid (HA) with low (40 kDa), medium (200 and 600 kDa) and high (2 MDa) molecular weight (Mw) was modified with adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) and used as reducing and capping agents to synthesise antimicrobial hybrid Ag NPs. The Mw of the polymer played a crucial role in the morphology, size and antibacterial activity of the Ag NPs. The 600 and 200 kDa HA-ADH-Ag NPs were able to reduce the  Escherichia coli  and  Staphylococcus aureus  concentration by more than 3 logs, while the 40 kDa NPs reached ~2 logs reduction. The 2 MDa HA-ADH failed to form homogenous NPs with strong bactericidal activity. A mechanistic study of the interaction with a model bacterial membrane using Langmuir isotherms confirmed the greater interaction between bacteria and higher Mw polymers and the effect of the NP\u2019s morphology.

When taking rifampin, oral contraceptives cannot be relied upon and a second method of contraception is mandatory. Amoxicillin, ampicillin, griseofulvin, metronidazole and tetracycline have been associated with contraceptive failure in three or more clinical cases. When these agents are used, the clinician should discuss the available data with the patient and suggest a second form of birth control.

ASD was defined from diagnostic codes in electronic medical records. Maternal multivitamin supplementation was assessed via questionnaire interview; maternal plasma folate and B 12  were measured from samples taken 2-3 days after birth. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Moderate (3-5 times/week) self-reported supplementation during pregnancy was associated with decreased risk of ASD, consistent with previous findings. Using this as the reference group, low (\u22642 times/week) and high (>5 times/week) supplementation was associated with increased risk of ASD. Very high levels of maternal plasma folate at birth (\u226560.3 nmol/L) had 2.5 times increased risk of ASD (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 4.6) compared to folate levels in the middle 80 th  percentile, after adjusting for covariates including MTHFR genotype. Similarly, very high B 12  (\u2265536.8 pmol/L) showed 2.5 times increased risk (95% CI 1.4, 4.5). \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             There was a \u201cU\u201d shaped relationship between maternal multivitamin supplementation frequency and ASD risk. Extremely high maternal plasma folate and B 12  levels at birth were associated with ASD risk. This hypothesis-generating study does not question the importance of consuming adequate folic acid and vitamin B 12  during pregnancy; rather, raises new questions about the impact of extremely elevated levels of plasma folate and B 12  exposure in-utero on early brain development.",

    "question": "Hi,\n\nI\u2019m 34f, 4.5 weeks pregnant with first baby so very early along, i just missed my period. when I got the positive test I messaged my pcp and she ran three blood hcg tests:\n\n12dpo: 72\n14dpo: 145\n16dpo: 488\n\nI requested she add on labs  for common vitamin levels because I did the ancestryDNA health add-on and it showed I\u2019m likely to have low levels of vitamin a and e. She said those are not vitamins she\u2019d normally test for but she did test my folate, iron, vitamin d, and b12. Everything was normal except folate was flagged as high at >20 ng/ml. An actual value was not provided other than >20 ng/ml. Standard lab range listed as >5.9ng/ml. \n\nI take Bayer one a day prenatal, have been taking for about 6 months or so. It contains folic acid 800 mcg.\n\nI am concerned because I\u2019ve seen the studies describing desirable folic acid levels as a bell curve, where too low can causes neural tube defects but too high can cause autism. I don\u2019t know my exact value because it exceeded the lab cutoff but it\u2019s at least approaching or exceeding the at-risk values cited in the studies I saw. Links to studies in comment. \n\nWhat should I do?? I have other autism risk factors (first cousin w/ autism, BMI 32) and I want to do everything I can to have a healthy baby. Could I take the vitamin every other day as mentioned in study # 2 or take one with lower levels?

    "document": "Maternal blood folate status during early pregnancy and occurrence of autism spectrum disorder in offspring: a study of 62 serum biomarkers\nBackground \n             Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) evolves from an interplay between genetic and environmental factors during prenatal development. Since identifying maternal biomarkers associated with ASD risk in offspring during early pregnancy might result in new strategies for intervention, we investigated maternal metabolic biomarkers in relation to occurrence of ASD in offspring using both univariate logistic regression and multivariate network analysis. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Serum samples from 100 women with an offspring diagnosed with ASD and 100 matched control women with typically developing offspring were collected at week 14 of pregnancy. Concentrations of 62 metabolic biomarkers were determined, including amino acids, vitamins (A, B, D, E, and K), and biomarkers related to folate (vitamin B 9 ) metabolism, lifestyle factors, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), the kynurenine-tryptophan ratio (KTR), and neopterin as markers of inflammation and immune activation. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             We found weak evidence for a positive association between higher maternal serum concentrations of folate and increased occurrence of ASD (OR per 1 SD increase: 1.70, 95% CI 1.22\u20132.37, FDR adjusted  P  = 0.07). Multivariate network analysis confirmed expected internal biochemical relations between the biomarkers. Neither inflammation markers nor vitamin D 3  levels, all hypothesized to be involved in ASD etiology, displayed associations with ASD occurrence in the offspring. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Our findings suggest that high maternal serum folate status during early pregnancy may be associated with the occurrence of ASD in offspring. No inference about physiological mechanisms behind this observation can be made at the present time because blood folate levels may have complex relations with nutritional intake, the cellular folate status and status of other B-vitamins. Therefore, further investigations, which may clarify the potential role and mechanisms of maternal blood folate status in ASD risk and the interplay with other potential risk factors, in larger materials are warranted.",

    "document": "Electronic cigarette use patterns and chronic health conditions among people experiencing homelessness in MN: a statewide survey\nBackground \n             Adults experiencing homelessness have higher rates of disease and premature morbidity compared to the general population. Tobacco use is a primary contributing factor to these disparities; however, less is known regarding e-cigarette use patterns among adults experiencing homelessness and whether e-cigarettes are used in a manner that is narrowing or widening health disparities. This study aimed to describe the 1) prevalence and trends in e-cigarette use, 2) correlates of e-cigarettes use, and 3) rates of chronic health conditions by product use pattern in a community-based sample of adults experiencing homelessness. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Adults experiencing homelessness in Minnesota were surveyed by self-report in 2015 ( n \u2009=\u20093672) and 2018 ( n \u2009=\u20094181) regarding e-cigarette and combustible cigarette use, potential correlates of e-cigarette use, and self-reported chronic health conditions (i.e., asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer). \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Frequency of use increased from 2015 to 2018 for combustible cigarettes (66.9% vs. 72.3%), e-cigarettes (11.4% vs. 14.5%), and dual combustible/e-cigarette use (10.2% vs. 12.9%). The strongest bivariate correlates of past 30-day e-cigarette use were younger age, non-binary gender identification, non-heterosexual orientation, identification as White/Caucasian, greater frequency of lifetime homelessness, substance use, lack of regular place for medical care, mental health diagnosis, criminal justice involvement, and combustible cigarette smoking.

    "document": "Vaping-associated esophagitis\nBackground \n             Vaping, or e-cigarettes, heat nicotine and other chemicals to create a vapor that is inhaled. The practice has gained rapid popularity with 41 million people globally reporting regular or occasional use. Although tobacco smoking is well-known to increase esophageal acid exposure by augmenting the number of reflux events, the effects of vaping on the gastrointestinal tract have not yet been elucidated. Our objective is to report a case of severe esophagitis associated with vaping, which is the first in the literature to our knowledge. \n           \n           \n             Case presentation \n             A 25-year-old male with a history of well-controlled gastro-esophageal reflux disease presented to the emergency room for evaluation of one week of severe odynophagia. He had been treated with a proton-pump inhibitor for several years with good effect. Approximately two months prior to presentation, he started vaping tetrahydrocannabinol and nicotine with recent heavy daily use. He denied any alcohol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. We performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy that revealed Los Angeles Grade C esophagitis (involving\u2009\u2265\u20091 mucosal breaks continuous between tops of\u2009\u2265\u20092 mucosal folds,\u2009<\u200975% circumferential). Histopathological analysis of esophageal biopsies demonstrated granulation tissue with acute and chronic inflammation. Periodic acid-Schiff-diastase staining was negative and immunohistochemical stains for herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus were negative. There was no evidence of eosinophilic esophagitis. We treated him with intravenous PPI and analgesics until he was able to tolerate oral intake. He was counseled extensively on vaping cessation and reported complete resolution of symptoms after 2 months. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             This patient\u2019s presentation illustrates a serious gastrointestinal consequence of vaping, the long-term consequences of which warrant additional studies. Like smoking, the mechanism of injury in vaping may be, at least in part, due to the effects of nicotine. As prevalence of vaping continues to rise, clinicians should be aware of this complication and carefully solicit a patient\u2019s vaping history as a simple denial of \u201csmoking\u201d can be misleading.",

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the association between AChEIs and the risk of bleeding and cardiovascular ischemic events in patients with non\u2010hypertensive AD. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             A nested case\u2010control study was conducted to estimate the risk of bleeding and ischemic events (angina, myocardial infarction [MI], and stroke) in patients with AD. This study was conducted using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) databases. The study cohort consisted of AD patients \u226565 years of age. The case groups included all AD subjects in the database who had a bleeding or ischemic event during the cohort follow\u2010up. Four controls were selected for each case. Patients were classified as current users or past users based on a 60\u2010day threshold of consuming the drug. Simple and multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses were used to calculate the adjusted odds ratio for bleeding events and cardiovascular events. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             We identified 507 cases and selected 2028 controls for the bleeding event cohort and 555 cases and 2220 controls for the ischemic event cohort. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for the association of AChEI use was 0.93 (0.75 to 1.16) for bleeding events, 2.58 (1.01 to 6.59) for angina, and 1.89 (1.07 to 3.33) for MI. Past users of AChEIs were also at increased risk of stroke (1.51 [1.00 to 2.27]). \n           \n           \n             Discussion \n             This is the first study assessing the risk of bleeding and cardiovascular events in patients with non\u2010hypertensive AD. Our findings could be of great interest for clinicians and researchers working on AD.",

    "question": "I'm a 32-year-old woman (60kg, 154cm) who has been suffering from gastrointestinal symptoms for three years, now. It started as loud belching and was initially diagnosed to be reflux disease after my first gastroscopy. When I experienced no relief (after 2 gastroscopies and a year of acid control medicines and even antibiotics), they told me it's all in my head and referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist didn't agree with them but put me on some medications anyway. No relief again.\n\nAs of 6 months ago, I've begun to throw up fibrous bits of food between 10 to 36 hours after eating. At first, it was only raw vegetable skins or hard veggies such as grated carrots and tomato peel and I was still doing fine with everything else and specifically bread, pasta, and potatoes (almost no symptoms when I eat these foods). The first month on this fiber elimination diet was as if I had found the cure. The belching issue was 90% gone! And, to my surprise, another health condition I had always thought of as a constant in my life was suddenly 100% eliminated: Migraines!!!!!\n\nThese migraines had been with me for 15 years and used to happen to me 2 to 3 times a week (always began 2 hours after a meal!). For the first time in15 years, I wasn't getting migraines anymore!\n\nBut, then, things got worse. Even, skinless fairly chopped vegetables began to come up too and I had to completely give up eating raw vegetables. Then, I was fine for another 30-40 days on this no raw-veggie diet.\n\nAfter that, the foods that were too fatty were also added to the equation (such as cookies I had made with butter or fried foods). As of a few days ago, I even throw up cooked grated carrots and the roasted bits of flatbread! My current diet is more or less limited to pasta, cake, white toast, mashed potato, tomato paste, eggs, and mashed carrot along with blended fruits.\n\nDuring these three years, I've had 3 gastroscopies, 1 colonoscopy, 1 CT scan (which showed thickening of the antropyloric region of the stomach), 1 scintigraphy (normal), and 1 MR enterography (a few days ago and normal).\n\nMy doctor is now trying to convince me that it is functional dyspepsia. But, I have a hard time accepting it because:\n\n1. My symptoms are getting worse day by day and as far as I have researched, Functional dyspepsia is not a constantly worsening condition (although it might come and go)\n2. The diet that makes me feel better is almost the opposite of the Functional dyspepsia diet (FD diet recommends a lot of fibers and elimination of pasta for instance!)\n3. Fibrous foods sometimes get stuck somewhere in my gastrointestinal tract for up to 36 hours before coming up despite having vomited everything in my stomach earlier until I was throwing up clear water (As if they have returned to the stomach from my duodenum!)\n4. My bowel makes very loud funny noises that can be heard by someone sitting beside me\n5. My ability to pass gas had decreased by 80% since 3 years ago and only came back when I stopped eating fibers. \n\nI know I am not a doctor, but I strongly believe that I have a sort of stenosis somewhere. I talked to my doctor about adult hypertrophic pyloric stenosis and pointed out the thickening of the stomach wall as a clue. But, he said it can't be as the scintigraphy test is negative and ordered the MR Enterography. Now, he says it has to be functional dyspepsia as the Enterography result is also negative. But, as I researched, there's a 22% chance that MR Enterography results come out false negative when diagnosing stenosis.\n\nSo, Are there any other tests or ways of diagnosing different types of stenosis left?",
    "document": "Adult idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis - a common presentation with an uncommon diagnosis\nABSTRACT \n           Background and Objectives:  Adult Idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (AIHPS) is a rare but well-defined entity in adults with only 200-300 cases reported so far in the literature.We describe a case of AIHPS and the relevant literature review. \n           Methods and Results:  The patient presented with acute onset upper abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, foul-smelling black tarry stools, and anorexia. On the Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), pylorus demonstrated a unique \u201ccervix sign.\u201d The patient had multiple endoscopic dilations with minimal relief. She then underwent a distal partial gastrectomy with a Billroth 1 gastroduodenostomy with considerable \u00a0improvement in her symptoms on follow up. \n           Conclusion : Adult Idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (AIHPS) is a rare disease which is also underreported due to a difficulty in diagnosis. The most common symptoms of AIHPS are postprandial nausea, vomiting, early satiety, and epigastric pain as seen in our patient. Endoscopy usually shows ?Cervix sign? a unique sign showing a fixed, markedly narrowed pylorus with a smooth border. Multiple treatments have been proposed for AIHPS, including endoscopic dilation, pyloromyotomy with or without pyloroplasty, gastrectomy with a Billroth 1 gastroduodenostomy. Currently, there is no evidence of one surgical technique being superior to another. Further research needs to be done on AIHPS before one technique can be standardized as the standard of care.",

    "question": "19yo F here, 60kg, 5'5'', very healthy, religious and virgin.\n\nI have been researching the HPV gardasil shot and am really on the fence about whether to get it or not. My PCP and GYN are urging me to, saying I might get cancer and warts if I don't. I am very religious and am currently dating another virgin boy who I plan to marry soon and have children within 2-3 years, we are strictly monogamous. Adding this in because I think I'm at a much lower risk than most other 19 year-olds for that reason.\n\nMy doctors say now is the ideal time to get the shot but considering my low risk factor I want to know whether it is truly safe or not. My cousin actually developed GBS after the shot and almost died, luckily she did recover but it was a scare for the entire family and another reason why we've put it off. We thought maybe she was just a rare 1/1,000,000 event but then we started reading more and more stories.\n\nI've read many many stories online in facebook groups and have seen movies about seriously scary adverse events including permanent arthritis, autoimmune conditions, paralysis, seizures, and chronic health issues. I've spoken to a few young women and mothers who say that their daughters are now disabled for years since the shot. Even a couple of my friends say they developed chronic fatigue or other weird health problems after. There seems to be something strange about this vaccine.\n\nAre these stories real? What's happening? If the shot is so dangerous then why do doctors say it's safe and why do they continue to recommend it? \n\nI am not ethically or religiously opposed to the shot, I just don't know if it's worth it to me for the benefits vs. risks. The only chance I'd have of developing an HPV infection is if my husband cheated which I feel quite certain he won't, or if we were to divorce and date again later in life, but again I find that highly unlikely as we have a very stable relationship and are very committed. There is very little cancer in my family with the exception of my great uncle who smoked cigarettes and developed lung cancer. Besides that my family is very healthy, religious, monogamous, and long-lived (I understand this may not be relevant, but thought I would add this).\n\nI made this account because I am very distressed about the decision and I want to know the truth, I want to know whether gardasil (hpv shot) is safe and whether these adverse events are truly connected to the shot. Thank you!",
    "document": "The impact of 10 years of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Australia: what additional disease burden will a nonavalent vaccine prevent?\nBackground: A National human papilloma virus (HPV) Vaccination Programme for the prevention of HPV infection and associated disease using the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) has been funded and implemented in Australia since 2007, initially for girls only and extended to boys in 2013, with uptake rates among the highest observed worldwide. Aim: We report on the impact of this national programme on HPV prevalence and associated disease burden and estimate the potential impact of adopting a nonavalent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine. Methods: We performed a non-systematic literature review of studies measuring the burden of HPV-associated disease and infection in Australia before and after introduction of HPV vaccination. We also included key national reports with estimates of HPV-related disease burden. Results: Substantial declines in high-grade cervical disease and genital warts among vaccine-eligible women have been observed. Reductions in genital warts incidence and HPV prevalence among heterosexual men of similar age were observed before introduction of the male vaccination programme, indicating a substantial herd effect. 9vHPV vaccine is expected to prevent up to 90% of cervical and 96% of anal cancers. Of an estimated 1,544 HPV-associated cancers in 2012, 1,242 would have been preventable by the 4vHPV vaccine and an additional 187 anogenital cancers by the 9vHPV vaccine. Conclusions: Vaccination using 4vHPV vaccine has had a large demonstrable impact on HPV-related disease in Australia. A switch to 9vHPV could further reduce the HPV-associated cancer burden. With continued high coverage among both males and females, elimination of vaccine-type HPV disease seems achievable in Australia.",

Furuncles appear as red, swollen, and tender nodules on hair-bearing parts of the body, and the most common infectious agent is  Staphylococcus aureus , but other bacteria may also be causative. In some countries, methicillin resistant  S. aureus  is the most common pathogen in skin and soft tissue infections which is problematic since treatment is difficult. Furunculosis often tends to be recurrent and may spread among family members. Some patients are carriers of  S. aureus  and eradication should be considered in recurrent cases. Solitary lesions should be incised when fluctuant, whereas patients with multiple lesions or signs of systemic disease or immunosuppression should be treated with relevant antibiotics. The diagnostic and therapeutic approach to a patient suspected of staphylococcosis should include a thorough medical history, clinical examination, and specific microbiological and biochemical investigations. This is particularly important in recurrent cases where culture swabs from the patient, family members, and close contacts are mandatory to identify and ultimately control the chain of infection.

    "question": "So I\u2019m old (40) and I can\u2019t figure out how to link my old post, but here goes. I was having stomach and abdominal pain so bad that I didn\u2019t want to be here anymore. Well I was at a wedding this weekend, and I got out of the limousine and fell on my knees. My legs just gave out. I was tired but nothing out of the ordinary. (This is important later.) I went through the weekend and was at work Monday when I started to feel nauseous. I went another two hours feeling dizzy and nauseous and having severe heart palpitations. I keep going for another 20 mins until I start seeing black and white spots. I know if I stay I\u2019m gonna pass out and they won\u2019t find me, so I run to my bosses office and tell her I need to go to the hospital now. She sits me down and the school nurse comes and takes my pulse (99) and calls my husband. \n\nI go to urgent care, who throws me into a wheel chair and after triage tells me I need to go to the ED right now. I go, they get me in ASAP and hook me up to heart monitors. Nurse comes in and draws blood. They tell me I\u2019m staying for a few hours to get a second blood draw in two hours. Doc comes in abs tells me that I my potassium levels are super low (2.6) and that I have to have an IV with some potassium in it. Cool. I\u2019m okay with that. Apparently low potassium levels can cause your heart to stop, and also cause your stomach to stop working, which causes pain as well as explain why my legs have given out and my weird leg cramping and fire like lava going through my legs, as well as having absolutely ZERO energy. I have been dealing with palpitations for a year, but I also have anxiety so it was impossible to know what was causing it all this time. \n\nI\u2019ll tell you, I felt like super woman after they gave me that IV. I can\u2019t believe I lived this way so long when this was what I needed. My heart stopped fluttering but I do still have a few light palpitations and some dizziness. I can actually have a bowel movement and I don\u2019t stay full on one meal a day. It always felt like food just sat in my stomach forever. I am getting a holter monitor for 5 days, and my potassium levels checked again in two weeks. \n\nI\u2019m hoping this is the answer for me.

    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

    "question": "For context, this was late 2000s (2007-2010 maybe) in Missouri. I've been having terrible flashbacks of the doctor donning the gloves, opening the packet of lube, and preparing to \"examine\" me. As far as I know, I was a completely healthy kid and had no troubles concerning my genitals, especially none that would warrant a full-on examination like that. I remember the doctor always trying to coerce me into letting these things that I was uncomfortable with happen. (as any child would've been.) Not to mention that this was a recurring thing. Is internal examination even part of your average physical checkup?? And for it to possibly be for detecting something, shouldn't once be enough? I know that problems can come back but this is something traumatic for a small child to go through wouldn't the doctor understand that and ask about symptoms first before doing it again?  I could go on a whole schpiel on how my parents are irresponsible (for unrelated reasons, long story, irrelevant) but regardless of that, I don't remember whether or not my mom or dad were present in the room when these things were happening to me. But yeah, is this okay at all? Even if it was just them doing their job, I STRONGLY remember being distraught and refusing it all, but having it happen anyway. I've been hearing things like \"you were a little kid so whether you consented or not it's okay for them to do it\" But is that true? I understand that whether a kid is willing to get a shot or not they still have to get it, but isn't it different for physicals?\n\nHonestly having answers to my questions isn't gonna undo what happened to me, but it's closure I guess?  Kind of unrelated but I've had a lot of traumatic things happen to me throughout my childhood and I'm trying to pick it apart since I've developed a disorder because of it, as memories come up I try to pick them apart as best I can. Really all I wanna know if what happened was allowed or it was deviation from procedure and possibly child abuse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: this doesn't really pertain to this story but I do get UTIs a lot but that's like a very current thing as of a few years ago, long after this incident happened, it wasn't a present issue at the time of this story. I will be trying to get a hold of the medical records from this time to see if this doctor is still in practice but I've moved all the way to California so I'm not at any doctor near where this happened. I don't wanna sound all \"aw poor me\" but I have VERY negligent parents so the likelihood of getting this information is slim. But whenever I see my current doctor (who is a saint) I'll be talking about this with her. Oh and don't worry! Picking apart and understanding this trauma isn't all up to me, I have many online mental health support groups to turn to and a loving boyfriend.\n\nEdit 2 (not super important but I feel should be said): I guess I should've given more context in terms of my mental health which I did not because of privacy reasons and because I didn't think it was all that relevant to the question, but yes, of course I've been to professionals in the past and am currently seeing the best that I can considering the current covid situation. Yes I was very young and of course, there is vagueness due to this being a part of trauma but despite that, it does not undermine the validity of this actually occurring. Because of the therapy I've been through, more and more suppressed memories of my childhood are uncovered, getting me closer and closer to proper treatment of my disorder. (which I don't feel the need to specify because it doesn't really have anything to do with the question at hand) Yes, I as a minor don't have access to the medical records from this time because that's something for my parents to be in charge of, but even if they weren't negligent, this occurred over a decade ago and in an entirely different state to the one I'm in now.\n\nTo the \"NOT A DOCTOR but I think you were too young to remember correct\" posts and things along those lines, my apologies for not providing enough context to mislead you to that conclusion, but I do want to say that your **unprofessional** opinion of you downplaying this malpractice is not helpful :)\n\nedit 3 (also not super important but HOLY CRAP) Uh jeez, I didn't think this post would get noticed let alone all this traction. \ud83d\ude28 Just thank you so much. That's all the words I really can say since I'm still awestruck. I appreciate the support people are giving me.

No meta-analysis has examined DRE for diagnosis of acute appendicitis. \n           \n           \n             Objectives \n             To assess the role of DRE for diagnosis of acute appendicitis. \n           \n           \n             Data Sources \n             Cochrane Library, PubMed, and SCOPUS from the earliest available date of indexing through November 23, 2014, with no language restrictions. \n           \n           \n             Study Selection \n             Clinical studies assessing DRE as an index test for diagnosis of acute appendicitis. \n           \n           \n             Data Extraction and Synthesis \n             Two independent reviewers extracted study data and assessed the quality, using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. Bivariate random-effects models were used for the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI). \n           \n           \n             Main Outcomes and Measures \n             The main outcome measure was the diagnostic performance of DRE for diagnosis of acute appendicitis. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             We identified 19 studies with a total of 7511 patients. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.49 (95% CI 0.42\u20130.56) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.67), respectively. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 1.24 (95% CI 0.97\u20131.58) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.70\u20131.02), respectively. The DOR was 1.46 (0.95\u20132.26). \n           \n           \n             Conclusion and Relevance \n             Acute appendicitis cannot be ruled in or out through the result of DRE. Reconsideration is needed for the traditional teaching that rectal examination should be performed routinely in all patients with suspected appendicitis.",
    "response": "Haven't seen any pediatrician comments. An internal exam, using a speculum or inserting fingers, is not a normal part of the annual exam. It IS normal to examine the external genitalia, and to gently spread the labia to examine what you can see internally without actually inserting anything. The primary things we look for are either common (rashes, skin issues, etc) or rare but significant (thin bands of tissue covering the vagina internally which will cause menstrual problems later, or subtle intersex disorders). The reason the exam is repeated is a quality control thing - we do the exam the same way every time, like a checklist, so we don't accidentally forget anything, and so that we don't make any assumptions. Lastly, many of the things we do are uncomfortable, so it is normal to try and persuade people - but part of that conversation is fully explaining what we're trying to do and why.\n\nTo give a real world example, I had a 13 year old girl who went through a great deal of abdominal pain because of hematocolpos, where she started having her period but the blood couldn't come out because of tissue covering the vagina. This should have been caught when she was a baby, but the mother had always refused to allow doctors to examine her genitalia.\n\nI'm sorry for your trauma. Hopefully this helps clarify what should happen in a normal visit."

We evaluated incidence rates of acute liver injury associated with oral azole antifungals. \n           \n           \n             METHODS \n             We conducted a cohort study among Kaiser Permanente Northern California members who initiated an oral azole antifungal in an outpatient setting during 2004\u20132010. We determined development of: (1) liver aminotransferases >200 U/L, (2) severe acute liver injury (coagulopathy with hyperbilirubinemia), and (3) acute liver failure. We calculated incidence rates of endpoints. Cox regression was used to determine whether chronic liver disease was a risk factor for outcomes. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS \n             Among 195,334 azole initiators (178,879 fluconazole; 14,296 ketoconazole; 1653 itraconazole; 478 voriconazole; 28 posaconazole), incidence rates (events/1000 person-years [95% confidence intervals (CIs)]) of liver aminotransferases >200 U/L were similarly low with fluconazole (13.0 [11.4\u201314.6]), ketoconazole (19.3 [13.8\u201326.3]), and itraconazole (24.5 [10.6\u201348.2]). Rates were higher with voriconazole (181.9 [112.6\u2013278.0]) and posaconazole (191.1 [23.1\u2013690.4]), but comparable. Severe acute liver injury was uncommon with fluconazole (2.0 [1.4\u20132.7]), ketoconazole (2.9 [1.1\u20136.3]), and itraconazole (0.0 [0.0\u201311.2]), but more frequent with voriconazole (16.7 [2.0\u201360.2]) and posaconazole (93.4 [2.4\u2013520.6]). One patient developed acute liver failure due to ketoconazole. Pre-existing chronic liver disease increased risks of aminotransferases >200 U/L (hazard ratio 4.68 [95% CI, 3.68\u20135.94]) and severe acute liver injury (hazard ratio 5.62 [95% CI, 2.56\u201312.35]). \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSIONS \n             Rates of acute liver injury were similarly low for fluconazole, ketoconazole, and itraconazole.

    "document": "Inference of demographic history from genealogical trees using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo\nBackground \n             Coalescent theory is a general framework to model genetic variation in a population. Specifically, it allows inference about population parameters from sampled DNA sequences. However, most currently employed variants of coalescent theory only consider very simple demographic scenarios of population size changes, such as exponential growth. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Here we develop a coalescent approach that allows Bayesian non-parametric estimation of the demographic history using genealogies reconstructed from sampled DNA sequences. In this framework inference and model selection is done using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). This method is computationally efficient and overcomes the limitations of related non-parametric approaches such as the skyline plot. We validate the approach using simulated data. Subsequently, we reanalyze HIV-1 sequence data from Central Africa and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) data from Egypt. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The new method provides a Bayesian procedure for non-parametric estimation of the demographic history.

    "document": "Energy drinks: Getting wings but at what health cost?\nEnergy drink consumption represents a global public health problem, especially among adolescents and young adults. The consumption of energy drinks has seen a substantial increase during the past few decades, especially in the Western and Asian countries. Although manufacturers of energy drinks claim that these beverages are beneficial in that they can boost energy, physical performance, and improve cognitive performance, there is insufficient scientific evidence to support these claims. The known and unknown pharmacology of the constituents of energy drinks, supplemented with reports of toxicity, raise concern for the potentially severe adverse events linked with energy drink use. Limited numbers of reviews have been published on this important subject..The aim of this review was to identify the major ingredients in energy drinks and to delineate the adverse effects related to their consumption. \n           Methods:  Electronic databases of PubMed, Clinical Key, and Google and Cochrane library were extensively searched for energy drink articles. More than hundred articles were reviewed, scrutinized and critically appraised and the most relevant forty articles were used \n           Conclusion:  Energy drinks & its ingredients are potentially dangerous to many aspects of health.

An MRI of the lumbar spine suggested spondylodiscitis at L4\u2013L5. After an unsuccessful and prolonged course of antibiotics, a decision was ultimately made to repair the aneurysm and bypass the aorto-iliac disease.

    "document": "Potential neoplastic evolution of Vero cells: in vivo and in vitro characterization\nVero cell lines are extensively employed in viral vaccine manufacturing. Similarly to all established cells, mutations can occur during Vero cells in vitro amplification which can result in adverse features compromising their biological safety. To evaluate the potential neoplastic evolution of these cells, in vitro transformation test, gene expression analysis and karyotyping were compared among low- (127 and 139 passages) and high-passage (passage 194) cell lines, as well as transformed colonies (TCs). In vivo tumorigenicity was also tested to confirm preliminary in vitro data obtained for low passage lines and TCs. Moreover, Vero cells cultivated in foetal bovine serum-free medium and derived from TCs were analysed to investigate the influence of cultivation methods on tumorigenic evolution. Low-passage Vero developed TCs in soft agar, without showing any tumorigenic evolution when inoculated in the animal model. Karyotyping showed a hypo-diploid modal chromosome number and rearrangements with no difference among Vero cell line passages and TCs. These abnormalities were reported also in serum-free cultivated Vero. Gene expression revealed that high-passage Vero cells had several under-expressed and a few over-expressed genes compared to low-passage ones. Gene ontology revealed no significant enrichment of pathways related to oncogenic risk. These findings suggest that in vitro high passage, and not culture conditions, induces Vero transformation correlated to karyotype and gene expression alterations. These data, together with previous investigations reporting tumour induction in high-passage Vero cells, suggest the use of low-passage Vero cells or cell lines other than Vero to increase the safety of vaccine manufacturing. \n           \n             Electronic supplementary material \n             The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s10616-017-0082-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

The virus quickly spread and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. After infection, symptoms such as fever, a (dry) cough, nasal congestion, and fatigue can develop. In some cases, the virus causes severe complications such as pneumonia and dyspnea and could result in death. The virus also spread rapidly in the Netherlands, a small and densely populated country with an aging population. Health care in the Netherlands is of a high standard, but there were nevertheless problems with hospital capacity, such as the number of available beds and staff. There were also regions and municipalities that were hit harder than others. In the Netherlands, there are important data sources available for daily COVID-19 numbers and information about municipalities. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             We aimed to predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands, using a data set with the properties of 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and advanced modeling techniques. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We collected relevant static data per municipality from data sources that were available in the Dutch public domain and merged these data with the dynamic daily number of infections from January 1, 2020, to May 9, 2021, resulting in a data set with 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and variables grouped into 20 topics. The modeling techniques random forest and multiple fractional polynomials were used to construct a prediction model for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The final prediction model had an  R 2  of 0.63. Important properties for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality in the Netherlands were exposure to particulate matter with diameters <10 \u03bcm (PM10) in the air, the percentage of Labour party voters, and the number of children in a household. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Data about municipality properties in relation to the cumulative number of confirmed infections in a municipality in the Netherlands can give insight into the most important properties of a municipality for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality. This insight can provide policy makers with tools to cope with COVID-19 and may also be of value in the event of a future pandemic, so that municipalities are better prepared.",

Read below for more  information.**\n\n**Clearly  people aren\u2019t actually reading this and just asking the above anyway,  I\u2019m no longer going to reply to these questions. I generally reply to  all questions, if I haven\u2019t replied to yours it\u2019s because you\u2019re either  asking the above or your answer is contained within this post.**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nCOVID-19  means coronavirus disease 19 (as it was first reported to the WHO on  NYE in 2019). It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).\n\n**Why is it so bad?**\n\nCOVID-19  is very contagious. Current data suggests an R0 (that is the number of  people an infected person will go onto infect) of 2.5-3. By comparison  your average seasonal flu with have an R0 of about 1.3. To put this into  perspective, if you start with 10 people infected with seasonal flu,  over ten infection cycles you\u2019ll end up with about 138 infected people.  With COVID-19 over the same ten cycles you\u2019ll end up with tens of  thousands to hundreds of thousands of infected people. Bear in mind this  is not what is going to happen, only what could happen if the a disease  was left to spread without effort to slow it. Public health measures to  contain it can massively reduce the actual transmission rate.\n\n**How come more people don\u2019t have it?**\n\nWe  only know how many confirmed cases we have. For every one person who is  ill enough to be tested there\u2019s a large group who have mild symptoms  only and aren\u2019t tested. This number varies wildly but seems to be about 1  in 10 (ie for every confirmed case there\u2019s another 9 people out there  who have COVID but aren\u2019t symptomatic enough to get tested.\n\n**How do I know if I have it?**\n\nThe  most common symptoms are a fever and a persistent cough. Other flu like  symptoms may be experienced. It will be very variable from one person  to another. The only way to know is to be tested - access to that  depends on what\u2019s being done where you live.\n\n**Can I find out if I\u2018ve had it already?**\n\nRight now no. There is a test in development.\n\n**Am I going to die?**\n\nAbout  1 in 8 of the KNOWN cases (ie only those who are confirmed to have  COVID) will end up being hospitalised. About 1 in 6 of this group will  become critically ill and need to be managed on an ICU. Of this ICU  group about half will die.\n\nFor the  7 out of 8 cases who aren\u2019t hospitalised the symptoms are mild enough  to be managed at home. Remember for each of these people there\u2019s another  8-9 who aren\u2019t even aware they have it.

    "document": "Microbial Contents of Vacuum Cleaner Bag Dust and Emitted Bioaerosols and Their Implications for Human Exposure Indoors\nVacuum cleaners can release large concentrations of particles, both in their exhaust air and from resuspension of settled dust. However, the size, variability, and microbial diversity of these emissions are unknown, despite evidence to suggest they may contribute to allergic responses and infection transmission indoors. This study aimed to evaluate bioaerosol emission from various vacuum cleaners. We sampled the air in an experimental flow tunnel where vacuum cleaners were run, and their airborne emissions were sampled with closed-face cassettes. Dust samples were also collected from the dust bag. Total bacteria, total archaea,  Penicillium / Aspergillus , and total  Clostridium  cluster 1 were quantified with specific quantitative PCR protocols, and emission rates were calculated.  Clostridium botulinum  and antibiotic resistance genes were detected in each sample using endpoint PCR. Bacterial diversity was also analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), image analysis, and band sequencing. We demonstrated that emission of bacteria and molds ( Penicillium / Aspergillus ) can reach values as high as 1E5 cell equivalents/min and that those emissions are not related to each other. The bag dust bacterial and mold content was also consistent across the vacuums we assessed, reaching up to 1E7 bacterial or mold cell equivalents/g. Antibiotic resistance genes were detected in several samples. No archaea or  C. botulinum  was detected in any air samples. Diversity analyses showed that most bacteria are from human sources, in keeping with other recent results. These results highlight the potential capability of vacuum cleaners to disseminate appreciable quantities of molds and human-associated bacteria indoors and their role as a source of exposure to bioaerosols.",

Read what\u2019s written below - age is  the most important factor in determining someone\u2019s risk of severe  disease (ie needing hospital admission) or death.**\n\n**Do  not list your symptoms and ask if we can tell you whether you have  COVID-19 or what precautionary measures you should take - we can\u2019t. You  should follow you local public health guidance. If in doubt, isolate and  only go to the hospital if absolutely necessary. Read below for more  information.**\n\n**Clearly  people aren\u2019t actually reading this and just asking the above anyway,  I\u2019m no longer going to reply to these questions. I generally reply to  all questions, if I haven\u2019t replied to yours it\u2019s because you\u2019re either  asking the above or your answer is contained within this post.**\n\n**What is it?**\n\nCOVID-19  means coronavirus disease 19 (as it was first reported to the WHO on  NYE in 2019). It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute  respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).\n\n**Why is it so bad?**\n\nCOVID-19  is very contagious. Current data suggests an R0 (that is the number of  people an infected person will go onto infect) of 2.5-3. By comparison  your average seasonal flu with have an R0 of about 1.3. To put this into  perspective, if you start with 10 people infected with seasonal flu,  over ten infection cycles you\u2019ll end up with about 138 infected people.  With COVID-19 over the same ten cycles you\u2019ll end up with tens of  thousands to hundreds of thousands of infected people. Bear in mind this  is not what is going to happen, only what could happen if the a disease  was left to spread without effort to slow it. Public health measures to  contain it can massively reduce the actual transmission rate.\n\n**How come more people don\u2019t have it?**\n\nWe  only know how many confirmed cases we have. For every one person who is  ill enough to be tested there\u2019s a large group who have mild symptoms  only and aren\u2019t tested. This number varies wildly but seems to be about 1  in 10 (ie for every confirmed case there\u2019s another 9 people out there  who have COVID but aren\u2019t symptomatic enough to get tested.\n\n**How do I know if I have it?**\n\nThe  most common symptoms are a fever and a persistent cough. Other flu like  symptoms may be experienced. It will be very variable from one person  to another. The only way to know is to be tested - access to that  depends on what\u2019s being done where you live.\n\n**Can I find out if I\u2018ve had it already?**\n\nRight now no. There is a test in development.\n\n**Am I going to die?**\n\nAbout  1 in 8 of the KNOWN cases (ie only those who are confirmed to have  COVID) will end up being hospitalised. About 1 in 6 of this group will  become critically ill and need to be managed on an ICU. Of this ICU  group about half will die.\n\nFor the  7 out of 8 cases who aren\u2019t hospitalised the symptoms are mild enough  to be managed at home. Remember for each of these people there\u2019s another  8-9 who aren\u2019t even aware they have it. Some people have no symptoms,  for others it\u2019s the same and a bout of flu.\n\nThe  good news is if you\u2019re young you\u2019ll probably be fine.

    "document": "Efficacy of various disinfectants against SARS coronavirus\nSummary \n           The recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Asia and Northern America led to broad use of various types of disinfectant in order to control the public spread of the highly contagious virus. However, only limited data were available to demonstrate their efficacy against SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We therefore investigated eight disinfectants for their activity against SARS-CoV according to prEN 14476. Four hand rubs were tested at 30\u00a0s (Sterillium, based on 45% iso-propanol, 30% n-propanol and 0.2% mecetronium etilsulphate; Sterillium Rub, based on 80% ethanol; Sterillium Gel, based on 85% ethanol; Sterillium Virugard, based on 95% ethanol). Three surface disinfectants were investigated at 0.5% for 30\u00a0min and 60\u00a0min (Mikrobac forte, based on benzalkonium chloride and laurylamine; Kohrsolin FF, based on benzalkonium chloride, glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride; Dismozon pur, based on magnesium monoperphthalate), and one instrument disinfectant was investigated at 4% for 15\u00a0min, 3% for 30\u00a0min and 2% for 60\u00a0min [Korsolex basic, based on glutaraldehyde and (ethylenedioxy)dimethanol]. Three types of organic load were used: 0.3% albumin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.3% albumin with 0.3% sheep erythrocytes. Virus titres were determined by a quantitative test (endpoint titration) in 96-well microtitre plates. With all tested preparations, SARS-CoV was inactivated to below the limit of detection (reduction factor mostly \u22654), regardless of the type of organic load. In summary, SARS-CoV can be inactivated quite easily with many commonly used disinfectants.",

    "response": "Generally torsion is reserved for when something rotates about its own axis cutting off its own blood supply. This is why you might hear the terms \"testicular torsion\" or \"ovarian torsion\". I've not heard your scenario called that before. Where I practice we'd probably just say \"mechanical bowel obstruction secondary to appendicits\",\n\nMedicine does, however, have a lot of varied and colourful language that is, frequently, regional. So depending on where you live (or indeed where the doctor who treated you came from/ trained) they might say terms that other doctors aren't familiar with. Which doesn't mean there is necessarily one correct / universal term, especially for some more quirky/uncommon stuff.\n\nIndeed what one means by \"wrapped around\" may be different too. ie) did the appendix wrap around the bowel itself, did the appendix cause the bowel to twist around on itself (volvulus), did the appendix get pulled into the bowel causing the bowel to block off (intussusception), etc, etc.\n\nSo really, we might not know! You'd have to see if you could find your original hospital paperwork/discharge letter and see if anything like that was written there if you really want to know.

Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction.

    "question": "I am 25(f) and for about 6 years now I\u2019ve suffered from GERD after a few years of heavy drinking & a shitty diet in college really took a toll on me. My dad also had GERD and we had a lot of the same symptoms\u2014chronic heartburn, extreme pain in my sternum, nausea, etc. \n\nThen in 2017 I began having these SEVERE attacks that I initially attributed to a bad hangover. The symptoms were AWFUL...I would feel a tad nauseous the morning after drinking and vomit any food I had eaten. But soon after \u201cemptying\u201d my system & feeling a bit better, a dull, throbbing pain starts to develop in my torso (where my LES would be located) and I eventually have to vomit and it\u2019s all stomach bile. And the throwing up doesn\u2019t stop for hours. Any water I drink to rehydrate is quickly thrown back up as if nothing is allowed to enter my stomach. But the water almost helps because I\u2019m uncontrollably convulsing and regurgitating and trying to throw up nothing. The pain in my body is so severe and I experience extreme cold swets, lightheadedness, flashing lights when I close my eyes, and the inability to speak, swallow, move\u2014only throw up & make groaning noises. This begins and usually lasts a few hours and I will get myself into a hot bath or find a heating pad to help numb the pain in my stomach. I may take up to 5 baths/showers just trying to feel better but I\u2019m epileptic and the people who monitor me during my baths don\u2019t let me stay in long. No matter how much I want to eat or drink more water or do anything to \u201chelp\u201d myself, I physically can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have the ability to chew or swallow food, I feel so weak I tend to cry and need to crawl from room to room. It\u2019s gross but the bile comes out both ends and I feel like I have no control over any of my sphincter muscles. The worst days this will last for up to 12 hours but the after effects last for days. My body remains weak, my joints and entire torso hurt so bad, and I have such a fear of the lingering symptoms causing another episode that I have awful anxiety. \n\nThese episodes began initially after a few nights of heavy drinking but I soon noticed it would happen after eating GERD \u201ctrigger foods\u201d too. I attributed all of the episodes to GERD and worked to change my lifestyle diet to get healthier. I\u2019m slim & range 123-126lbs so I need to be smart about what I eat to make sure I\u2019m getting all my nutrients. I can go a very long time between episodes and have been able to reincorporate certain things into my life. I\u2019ve found drinking Gaviscon before drinking or eating something that may be triggering helps but still, when an episode does happen, it\u2019s so severe, my friends want to take me to a hospital & I have actual fears of *dying*. Sounds dramatic but every doctor I\u2019ve been to has dismissed it as drinking too much and told me to stop partying. But it\u2019s more than that. I can be fine for months then one day eat something acidic & I deteriorate so rapidly. My last episode was October 2020 and most recent was April 2021. October was after a single night of drinking. April was after a few weeks of heavy drinking, eating out a lot, etc. Then one day I was relaxing & the symptoms hit out of no where. I knew it was because of the way I had been treating my body but it was like my body let me get away with it for so long, so I just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t know of anyone else with GERD that has severe episodes like mine that are unbelievable for that long. \n\nThis is where marijuana comes in. I started smoking recreationally about 5 years ago (after my GERD diagnosis) and at first, I never noticed any problems or noticed it as a trigger to symptoms. But now, I use it almost every day and by definition would say I\u2019m a chronic user. It helps my anxiety, helps me sleep, it\u2019s fun, and I thought helped with nausea. After reading about cannabinoid hyperemisis syndrome (CHS), I do wonder if this could be what\u2019s causing my episodes but I also haven\u2019t seen CHS described as such. Because mine are so random and secluded, I can\u2019t tell if marijuana is the sole cause or if it\u2019s a combo of both? Also, my symptoms being relieved by baths/heat also are in line with CHS. \n\nI know the easy answer is to stop marijuana use & avoid trigger foods but it\u2019s easier said than done. I\u2019ve spent so many years adjusting my diet, trying to identify triggers, taking recommended vitamins and supplements to heal my digestive tract, cutting things in & out, etc, and it\u2019s exhausting. I am working on quitting smoking after my most recent episode because it\u2019s negatively affecting my life so much each time one happens. I will monitor if I see results from that but I still fear the damage that has been caused to my insides & don\u2019t even know what food I should be eating anymore. I don\u2019t want (and can\u2019t afford) to go to tons of doctors just to get half-assed diagnoses. \n\nSo I\u2019m looking for some advice I guess. Should I see a gastroenterologist again and demand scans that I\u2019ve constantly been denied in the past? Has anyone seen cases like mine and know of any treatment options besides what\u2019s found on a Google search because none of them work or help ): PPIs and other OTC medicines like TUMs don\u2019t work and often make me sicker too. Should I ask to be in a clinical study because I\u2019m basically convinced my insides are toxic sludge for a seemingly healthy young woman lol. Thanks for reading my story & offering any advice possible.",
    "document": "Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome\nCoinciding with the increasing rates of cannabis abuse has been the recognition of a new clinical condition known as Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, and frequent hot bathing. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome occurs by an unknown mechanism. Despite the well-established anti-emetic properties of marijuana, there is increasing evidence of its paradoxical effects on the gastrointestinal tract and CNS. Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabigerol are three cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant with opposing effects on the emesis response. The clinical course of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome may be divided into three phases: prodromal, hyperemetic, and recovery phase. The hyperemetic phase usually ceases within 48 hours, and treatment involves supportive therapy with fluid resuscitation and anti-emetic medications. Patients often demonstrate the learned behavior of frequent hot bathing, which produces temporary cessation of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The broad differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting often leads to delay in the diagnosis of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome shares several similarities with CHS and the two conditions are often confused. Knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and natural course of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is limited and requires further investigation.",

Currently using Lubiprostone for treatment to little avail.\n\nUpon my first visit with a new gastroenterologist she agreed with my suggestion that trying a low-dose SSRI may be a viable option to increasing gastrointestinal motility and then treating my IBS-C. When visiting the pharmacy I was expecting Citalopram which is an SSRI which I believe has the most clinical evidence against IBS-C. Instead, I found out that she prescribed Paroxetine (10MG PO daily), which I've read has undergone serious scrutiny for it's extensive list of serious side-effects. [\\[0\\]](\n\nFurther, I can't find much evidence in the literature for Paroxetine specifically in being efficacious against IBS-C. I've dug up essentially one small study [\\[1\\]]( from 20 years ago where patients on Paroxetine with IBS-C had good prognoses after several months. However, it seems like there are more heavily researched SSRIs which laud better safety profiles\u2014so I am curious as to why she is using Paroxetine as a first line of action treatment plan in my case. \n\nWhat do I not know here? In what instances is Paroxetine a viable first line of treatment option for IBS-C patients? To complicate things, I am currently on another SSRI Trazodone PO 50mg 1x/day at night for which she did not advise to stop use. Thank you!",
    "document": "SSRI Antidepressant Medications: Adverse Effects and Tolerability\nSide effects of antidepressants can be predicted by receptor selectivity and site of action. Although the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have better overall safety and tolerability than older antidepressants, broad-based experience with SSRIs has shown the frequency and type of side effects to be increased relative to clinical trial data. The author explores the reasons for the different profiles and discusses adverse effects, especially sexual dysfunction, weight gain, and sleep disturbance, the most troubling adverse events seen during long-term SSRI therapy. The informed management of these side effects by primary care practitioners supports successful treatment of depression.",
    "response": "There's no good reason to think that paroxetine is higher risk than citalopram. The SSRI's have also not been compared to each other in a meaningful way for treatment of IBS, only to TCA's or placebo. Further, there's a high degree of publication bias and a significant amount of placebo effect in SSRI use for IBS, so the true effectiveness is hard to determine. Certainly we don't know differences of medications within one class for IBS-C- that granularity cannot be teased out from the data. \n\nIf you want to discuss the medication you've been prescribed, the prescribing doctor would be a good resource. They may well be open to having you switch to citalopram. There's just no good reason to choose one over the other based on the existing evidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[\n\n[\n\n["

    "document": "The Distribution of Coumarins and Furanocoumarins in Citrus Species Closely Matches Citrus Phylogeny and Reflects the Organization of Biosynthetic Pathways\nCitrus  plants are able to produce defense compounds such as coumarins and furanocoumarins to cope with herbivorous insects and pathogens. In humans, these chemical compounds are strong photosensitizers and can interact with medications, leading to the \u201cgrapefruit juice effect\u201d. Removing coumarins and furanocoumarins from food and cosmetics imply additional costs and might alter product quality. Thus, the selection of  Citrus  cultivars displaying low coumarin and furanocoumarin contents constitutes a valuable alternative. In this study, we performed ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analyses to determine the contents of these compounds within the peel and the pulp of 61  Citrus  species representative of the genetic diversity all  Citrus . Generally,  Citrus  peel contains larger diversity and higher concentrations of coumarin/furanocoumarin than the pulp of the same fruits. According to the chemotypes found in the peel,  Citrus  species can be separated into 4 groups that correspond to the 4 ancestral taxa (pummelos, mandarins, citrons and papedas) and extended with their respective secondary species descendants. Three of the 4 ancestral taxa (pummelos, citrons and papedas) synthesize high amounts of these compounds, whereas mandarins appear practically devoid of them. Additionally, all ancestral taxa and their hybrids are logically organized according to the coumarin and furanocoumarin pathways described in the literature. This organization allows hypotheses to be drawn regarding the biosynthetic origin of compounds for which the biogenesis remains unresolved. Determining coumarin and furanocoumarin contents is also helpful for hypothesizing the origin of  Citrus  species for which the phylogeny is presently not firmly established. Finally, this work also notes favorable hybridization schemes that will lead to low coumarin and furanocoumarin contents, and we propose to select mandarins and Ichang papeda as  Citrus  varieties for use in creating species devoid of these toxic compounds in future breeding programs.",
    "response": "The compounds in grapefruit responsible for this interaction are lower in citron than grapefruit. If peel is involved, it\u2019s possible to be an issue with your medication. However citron pulp has very few furanocoumarins, and would be safe to eat while on Latuda. (\n\nRealistically, it takes a large consumption of grapefruit to affect enzymes, so moderation with citron should be just fine :)"

    "document": "Rapid Action of Retinoic Acid on the Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis\nRetinoic acid (RA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A but is also used as a medication, primarily for acne in which the treatment regime lasts several months. A number of studies have indicated that treatment with RA over this time period impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and may contribute to a number of the side-effects of the drug. No studies though have investigated the short-term, early effects RA may have on the HPA axis  via  the transcriptional pathways activated by the RA receptor. This study investigated the action of RA over 3 days on regulatory components of the HPA axis. Several key genes involved in glucocorticoid feedback pathways in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and pituitary were unchanged after 3-days exposure to RA. Key elements though in the adrenal gland involved in corticosterone and aldosterone synthesis were altered in particular with the  Cyp11b2  gene downregulated  in vivo  and  ex vivo . The rapid, 5 h, change in  Cyp11b2  expression suggested this activation may be direct. These results highlight the adrenal gland as a target of short-term action of RA and potentially a trigger component in the mechanisms by which the long-term adverse effects of RA treatment occur.",

    "document": "Isotretinoin and FoxO1\nOral isotretinoin (13-cis retinoic acid) is the most effective drug in the treatment of acne and restores all major pathogenetic factors of acne vulgaris. isotretinoin is regarded as a prodrug which after isomerizisation to all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) induces apoptosis in cells cultured from human sebaceous glands, meibomian glands, neuroblastoma cells, hypothalamic cells, hippocampus cells, Dalton's lymphoma ascites cells, B16F-10 melanoma cells, and neuronal crest cells and others. By means of translational research this paper provides substantial indirect evidence for isotretinoin's mode of action by upregulation of forkhead box class O (FoxO) transcription factors. FoxOs play a pivotal role in the regulation of androgen receptor transactivation, insulin/insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)-signaling, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAr\u03b3)- and liver X receptor-\u03b1 (LXr\u03b1)-mediated lipogenesis, \u03b2-catenin signaling, cell proliferation, apoptosis, reactive oxygene homeostasis, innate and acquired immunity, stem cell homeostasis, as well as anti-cancer effects. An accumulating body of evidence suggests that the therapeutic, adverse, teratogenic and chemopreventive effecs of isotretinoin are all mediated by upregulation of FoxO-mediated gene transcription. These FoxO-driven transcriptional changes of the second response of retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated signaling counterbalance gene expression of acne due to increased growth factor signaling with downregulated nuclear FoxO proteins. The proposed isotretinoin\u2192ATRA\u2192RAR\u2192FoxO interaction offers intriguing new insights into the mode of isotretinoin action and explains most therapeutic, adverse and teratogenic effects of isotretinoin in the treatment of acne by a common mode of FoxO-mediated transcriptional regulation.",

    "question": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI've had an ache in my right testicle since late January. I thought this was a tweaked nerve and felt little about it for awhile. I performed a couple self exams and while the area was tender, there didn't seem any real cause for concern.\n\nToward the end of March the discomfort emanating from my right testicle started to become more prevalent, particularly while having sex with my partner.\n\nApril 9 I went to an urgent care because I thought I had a UTI. I was diagnosed with epididymitis and given 2 weeks worth of doxycycline. I took this as prescribed; the infection seemed to go away but the aching persisted. Even worsened it seemed after I was done with the antibiotics.\n\nI should like to mention, at this point, that other symptoms have included: increased urgency to urinate, feeling like I have to clear my urethra to start peeing, and slight burning (but nothing alarming, just feels like i always have semen in my urethra). No blood and no further infection. I've pissed in so many cups for people at this point, its not the clap or chlamydia.\n\nIt effects me most while engaging in any physical activity. Running, working in the garden, skating, hiking, things I should be able to do readily at my age, all cause abdominal/groin discomfort. Sometimes it feels like I have perpetual blue balls.\n\nFinally one night toward the end of April I scared myself enough thinking about what this might be to go to the emergency room and ask that they ultrasound my testicles. At this point I thought \"this is either testicular cancer or an inguinal hernia.\"\n\nThe ultrasound revealed a cyst on my right testicle. I thought maybe this was the problem because a large amount of my discomfort seems to emanate from my right testicle. I finally got an appointment with a specialist after trying dozens of places to get an appointment.\n\nI was disheartened when the urologist seemed unconcerned. He said the cyst was not big enough to operate on and might even be an incidental finding. He said \"pains in these regions happen, and when they do you check them out. Sometimes you find nothing and there is no 'magic bullet' for them.\" He suggested taking loads of Ibuprofen, which I admit I avoid doing at all costs unless specifically instructed.\n\nI intend to take this advice for the next week or so, maybe ibuprofen will bring down ongoing inflammation, but having spent nearly $5,000 for a specialist to tell me to take ibuprofen feels horrible. I want to be able to get back to doing all of the things that make me feel happy and closing this uncomfortable little chapter, and I feel like I'm back at square one after having spent a ton of money.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice as to where to go from here? I continue to feel discomfort as previously described and I don't even have a doctor that I trust to hear me out. Another trip to the ER will cost at least what it did last time, which is $2,300.\n\nEdit1: More info--\n\nI also stopped drinking coffee and beer during the time period when i was taking doxycycline. I believe that symptoms have worsened since I began casually/regularly drinking both (coffee 1-2 cups a day, beer 1-3 at night.)\n\nAlso had a seeming flare-up once after drinking Kombucha since I stopped taking antibiotics and this whole ordeal began shortly after drinking kombucha.\n\nEdit: grammar",

I also don\u2019t use scented lotions or perfumes (which I\u2019ve tried in the past thinking it will cover up my odor) I seem to get really really bad reactions like it makes it worse . \n\nI\u2019ve read as much as I could on tmau and a major issue for me is I don\u2019t consume these major triggering foods (eggs, legumes, dairy, brassica vegetables) simply because I\u2019m picky. \n\nI\u2019ve dealt with this for years and this is actually a daily occurrence, I don\u2019t believe I suffer from olfactory reference syndrome. I decided many years ago it WAS in my head and to not worry about it. That isn\u2019t the case. I\u2019ve been pointed out by name as the reason it smells like poo. Actual poo, and farts.\n\nLast year I was diagnosed with hashimotos and while I don\u2019t believe the issues are related, I was excited to see a hormone dr. \n\nIt took me about 8 months to build up the courage to ask to have a urinalysis to see if I had TMAU. He had no clue what I was talking about and told me to ask my PCP. acknowledging this issue is crushing, and i cannot bear being dismissed by another dr because this issue is so rare. My PCP is great but also treats my entire family. I can\u2019t do it. The embarrassment that comes along with this is almost paralyzing. I literally freeze while I try to act oblivious that people are talking about me. Well I usually am since I never smell it, but when people are mean about it I act like I don\u2019t suspect they are speaking of me and have no clue about it, I simply don\u2019t acknowledge it when someone directly says to me \u2018it stinks, do you smell that?\u2019 \n\nI shower 2,3,4 times a day depending on how bad reactions I get from people are. I know how to properly clean myself. I\u2019m the cleanest person I know and still get the worst remarks. I can be fresh out of a shower and you would think I did not shower because I still stink. It varies throughout my menstrual cycle and is usually at its worst when I am ovulating. I believe it may be hormonal for that reason but what causes someone to just smell like feces? \n\nThere is a hospital in Colorado that does testing for TMAU and they only accept tests ordered by a dr. I believe I will have trouble is finding a dr to take me seriously because they\u2019ve never heard of this issue. Anyone know of some way to get help?",
    "document": "Microbiota and Malodor\u2014Etiology and Management\nAccumulating evidence indicates that microbiota plays a critical role in physiological processes in humans. However, it might also contribute to body malodor by producing numerous odorous molecules such as ammonia, volatile sulfur compounds or trimethylamine. Although malodor is commonly overlooked by physicians, it constitutes a major problem for many otherwise healthy people. Thus, this review aims to investigate most common causes of malodor and describe potential therapeutic options. We searched PUBMED and Google Scholar databases to identify the clinical and pre-clinical studies on bad body smell, malodor, halitosis and microbiota. Unpleasant smell might originate from the mouth, skin, urine or reproductive fluids and is usually caused by odorants that are produced by resident bacterial flora. The accumulation of odorous compounds might result from diet, specific composition of microbiota, as well as compromised function of the liver, intestines and kidneys. Evidence-based guidelines for management of body malodor are lacking and no universal treatment exists. However, the alleviation of the symptoms may be achieved by controlling the diet and physical elimination of bacteria and/or accumulated odorants.",

    "document": "Marijuana and Cardiac Arrhythmias: A Scoping Study\nWith increasing legalization, marijuana has become the most commonly abused substance in the United States. Together with the introduction of more potent marijuana products over the years, more adverse events are being reported and clinically characterized. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the active psychotropic component of marijuana, which acts mainly on G-protein cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. Multiple isolated cases of arrhythmias associated with marijuana use have been published. In this manuscript we conduct a scoping study of a total of 27 cases of arrhythmia associated with marijuana. Most cases were reported in young males (81%) with a mean age of 28 \u00b1 10.6 years. Atrial fibrillation (26%) and ventricular fibrillation (22%) were the most common arrhythmias reported. Brugada pattern was reported in 19% of the patients. Marijuana associated arrhythmia resulted in a high mortality rate of 11 %. While the exact mechanisms of arrhythmias associated with marijuana are not clear, several hypothesis have been introduced including the effect of marijuana on cardiac ion channels as well as its effects on the central nervous system. In this paper we discuss the possible mechanisms of marijuana induced arrhythmia citing the evidence available to-date.",

    "document": "Distribution of language-related Cntnap2 protein in neural circuits critical for vocal learning\nVariants of the contactin associated protein-like 2 (Cntnap2) gene are risk factors for language-related disorders including autism spectrum disorder, specific language impairment, and stuttering. Songbirds are useful models for study of human speech disorders due to their shared capacity for vocal learning, which relies on similar cortico-basal ganglia circuitry and genetic factors. Here, we investigate Cntnap2 protein expression in the brain of the zebra finch, a songbird species in which males, but not females, learn their courtship songs. We hypothesize that Cntnap2 has overlapping functions in vocal learning species, and expect to find protein expression in song-related areas of the zebra finch brain. We further expect that the distribution of this membrane-bound protein may not completely mirror its mRNA distribution due to the distinct subcellular localization of the two molecular species. We find that Cntnap2 protein is enriched in several song control regions relative to surrounding tissues, particularly within the adult male, but not female, robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), a cortical song control region analogous to human layer 5 primary motor cortex. The onset of this sexually dimorphic expression coincides with the onset of sensorimotor learning in developing males. Enrichment in male RA appears due to expression in projection neurons within the nucleus, as well as to additional expression in nerve terminals of cortical projections to RA from the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium. Cntnap2 protein expression in zebra finch brain supports the hypothesis that this molecule affects neural connectivity critical for vocal learning across taxonomic classes.",

    "question": "I'm writing this on behalf of my mom. She's 51, around 5'3 and 120 lbs, a current smoker, and currently taking Clobetosol, Calcipotrien, and Mupirocin (she was also taking Triamcinolon but stopped after having a bad reaction).\n\nMy mom was recently diagnosed with psoriasis, and to make matters worse this past weekend she went to the ER about two sore spots on her skin and it turned out to be a staph infection (they only drained 1 of the sores).\n\nUnfortunately she is allergic to the antibiotics they use to treat staph so for now all they gave her was the Mupirocin ointment and said she should use that for now and if it doesn't help, she might end up having to take the antibiotics that she's allergic to.\n\nToday she went to the dermatologist to see what else could be done and he advised her to use a benzoyl peroxide wash in the shower once a day for 2 weeks. He told her to buy it over the counter but didn't advise her what strength to buy. When she asked him if she should only apply it to the places where she has the staph infection, he just told her to use it 'everywhere' so she's confused, wondering if she should apply it to her face as well.\n\nThe problem is my mom has extremely sensitive skin, to the point where she can't even use most soaps, laundry detergents, perfumes, lotions, makeup etc and her skin is already very dry. She also bought 10% benzoyl peroxide because she wasn't sure which strength to buy.\n\nI expressed concern because I'm a bit of a skincare buff and I've read horror stories of people applying BP to their face for acne and completely wrecking their skin. So I'm really worried that she's going to have a bad reaction if she puts it on her face, especially since her skin is so sensitive.\n\nSo my question is--should my mom apply the BP to her face as well, even though her staph infection was on her leg and pubic area? If so, should she be starting with a lower strength? It seems like 10% is a really high percentage to start with.\n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",

Relevant factors directly influencing the development of AT comprise immune complex generation, complement activation, and changes in the production and activity of a complex network of cytokines, including type I and II interferons, B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), TNF \u03b1 , IL-6, IL-17 and migration macrophage inhibitor (MIF). Autoantibodies, also responsible for cytokine expression and activation, play a supplementary key role in the development of AT. Genomic and proteomic studies have contributed to the discovery of genes and proteins involved in AT, including some that may be suitable to be used as biomarkers. All that data has allowed the development of new drugs, most of them evaluated in clinical trials: inhibitors of IFN and TNF \u03b1 , B cell directed therapies, synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides, intravenous immunoglobulin, or statins.

I was told then the same, looked like an irritated mole caused by friction. Over the years, it progressed so slowly that it was hard to tell if it had gotten worse, better or stayed the same. Something about it always bothered me though. After noticing what appeared to be two more small spots appear, I went to a new dermatologist. Diagnosis: eczema. My spots were essentially completely flat. Purple/brownish color. Didn't look even like much. After two  weeks of trying Lotriderm (cortisone cream), the spots faded briefly but returned. At that point, I went back and insisted on a biopsy. The results, at first, were: Possible Bowenoid Papulosis. The lab ran other tests on the samples which confirmed 100% consistent with HPV-16. I had laser surgery to remove the spots 3 days after.\n\nA few days after surgery, the results from the pre-surgery biopsies came in with no evidence of invasion but confirmed high-grade carcinoma in-situ Stage 0. I set a date for my first control after 2 months.\n\nI'm married, have children and this all came as a huge shock to me. After reading more about HPV16, it's clear in men that penile, anal and mouth/head/neck cancers are completely possible. My wife has been checked and, thankfully, shows no signs of having this. She's considering getting the vaccination.\n\nHere are my concerns/questions:\n\n1. First of all, what am I dealing with here? I can already see some micro spots with the same look/color now coming on my glans. The biopsies taken at the laser center revealed all biopsies to be high-grade III, even a tiny spot I had removed that the surgeon said \"it looks like absolutely nothing\".\n2. I've have had a well defined red ring of skin around my anus (perianal region) for approx the same amount of time as I remember having the first mark (4+ years). It's very itchy often and have had it also written of as genetic eczema by two different derms. I have scheduled an appointment with a proctologist for a thorough investigation and I want also a biopsy of the perianal skin as it's clear HPV16 can cause cancer there too. Being a straight male that has never so much as experimented with male relationships or anything out of the ordinary with my female parters, how likely is it to have spread to my perianal region? I don't have lesions there, just raw skin. It bleeds sometimes due to my scratching of the area.\n3. I assume it's also prudent to have a dentist give my mouth a full check?\n4. What does my future look like? It seems with more spots suddenly popping up, I'm going to need more laser surgery. At some point, we can't laser my entire penis so, what are my other options?\n5. What should I be watching for in terms of invasive growth and/or spreadings? I have had an ultrasound of my testicles as well as my lymph nodes in the groin region all of which were normal.\n6. Is the virus still with me? I can't have any idea when I even contracted it.\n7. What does my sex life with my wife now look like? Only with protection or is it enough that she gets yearly screenings (and possible the vaccination)? We've been together for a long time and she gets screened yearly. Perhaps that means I am no longer contagious at this point? Or is that not possible to know?\n\nThe head dermatologist at the practice I visit has been somewhat dismissive over this whole thing saying oh it's nothing to worry about. I showed him the new spots and he said it's only an issue if they change over time. I then spoke with his colleague, the one who originally did the biopsy, and she was the opposite. She insisted the laser center remove and biopsy even the tiny spots and if they wouldn't to come back to her and she would biopsy them again. So I'm confused and slightly overwhelmed by this all. Looking forward to any help/answers/insight.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit**: two important points I forgot to include in my original post. I am circumcised. Also, I have a history of psoriasis which lead the first derm to believe this was a psoriasis patch over a mole.",
    "document": "Worldwide burden of cancer attributable to HPV by site, country and HPV type\nHPV is the cause of almost all cervical cancer and is responsible for a substantial fraction of other anogenital cancers and oropharyngeal cancers. Understanding the HPV\u2010attributable cancer burden can boost programs of HPV vaccination and HPV\u2010based cervical screening. Attributable fractions (AFs) and the relative contributions of different HPV types were derived from published studies reporting on the prevalence of transforming HPV infection in cancer tissue. Maps of age\u2010standardized incidence rates of HPV\u2010attributable cancers by country from GLOBOCAN 2012 data are shown separately for the cervix, other anogenital tract and head and neck cancers. The relative contribution of HPV16/18 and HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 was also estimated. 4.5% of all cancers worldwide (630,000 new cancer cases per year) are attributable to HPV: 8.6% in women and 0.8% in men. AF in women ranges from <3% in Australia/New Zealand and the USA to >20% in India and sub\u2010Saharan Africa. Cervix accounts for 83% of HPV\u2010attributable cancer, two\u2010thirds of which occur in less developed countries. Other HPV\u2010attributable anogenital cancer includes 8,500 vulva; 12,000 vagina; 35,000 anus (half occurring in men) and 13,000 penis. In the head and neck, HPV\u2010attributable cancers represent 38,000 cases of which 21,000 are oropharyngeal cancers occurring in more developed countries. The relative contributions of HPV16/18 and HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 are 73% and 90%, respectively. Universal access to vaccination is the key to avoiding most cases of HPV\u2010attributable cancer. The preponderant burden of HPV16/18 and the possibility of cross\u2010protection emphasize the importance of the introduction of more affordable vaccines in less developed countries. \n        \n           \n             What's new? \n           \n           Most cervical cancers result from human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and therefore are preventable through screening and vaccination. Nonetheless, efforts toward HPV\u2010attributable cancer prevention frequently are undermined by limited access to necessary resources. The present study estimates that worldwide as many as 4.5% of new cancer cases, including cancers of the cervix, anogenital tract and head and neck, are associated with HPV infection. Cervical cancer alone accounts for 83% of those cases, most of which affect women in less\u2010developed countries. The findings emphasize the importance of HPV screening and vaccination and the need for less\u2010costly vaccines.",

The idea behind the simultaneous use of sulfuric and ascorbic is to benefit from the double effect of ascorbic acid, as a leaching reducing agent and as morphological modifier during electrodeposition. Quantum chemical calculations based on the density functional theory are performed to explain the cobalt-ascorbate complexation during the electrocristalization. The optimum parameters for the leaching step are directly utilized in the preparation of an electrolyte for the electrodeposition process, to fabricate a superhydrophobic film with a contact angle of >150\u00b0 on plain carbon steel.

It is possibly related to one or both of iron or the sugar molecules in the injectafer, but we cannot know for sure. Currently, she is fearful that any injection, specifically a COVID-19 vaccine, could lead to another anaphylactic reaction. She is currently on 25mg of propranolol a day due to tachycardia that developed as a result of the anaphylaxis/trauma.\n\nIf she were to get a vaccine, and god forbid there was an allergic reaction, would she be safe to have epinephrine administered? If she is able to get vaccinated, we would by all means do it at a hospital and not at a pharmacy.\n\nAlso, anyone replying with a deep knowledge of injectafer or iron allergies, your knowledge or connections would be very welcomed.",
    "document": "Hypersensitivity reactions to intravenous iron: guidance for risk minimization and management\nIntravenous iron is widely used for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia when oral iron is inappropriate, ineffective or poorly tolerated. Acute hypersensitivity reactions during iron infusions are very rare but can be life-threatening. This paper reviews their frequency, pathogenesis and risk factors, and provides recommendations about their management and prevention. Complement activation-related pseudo-allergy triggered by iron nanoparticles is probably a more frequent pathogenetic mechanism in acute reactions to current formulations of intravenous iron than is an immunological IgE-mediated response. Major risk factors for hypersensitivity reactions include a previous reaction to an iron infusion, a fast iron infusion rate, multiple drug allergies, severe atopy, and possibly systemic inflammatory diseases. Early pregnancy is a contraindication to iron infusions, while old age and serious co-morbidity may worsen the impact of acute reactions if they occur. Management of iron infusions requires meticulous observation, and, in the event of an adverse reaction, prompt recognition and severity-related interventions by well-trained medical and nursing staff.",
    "response": "If she's never had an issue with another vaccine, I wouldn't be highly concerned. She would absolutely be able to get epi if needed - being on a beta-blocker isn't a contraindication for treatment of an anaphylactic reaction. We are watching all people who get the COVID vaccine for 15-30 minutes after vaccination just to monitor for side effects."

In the present report we demonstrate for the first time the presence of PrP c  on squamous epithelia of normal and diseased human skin and show that inflammatory cytokines regulate PrP c  expression in cultured human keratinocytes (KCs). By immunohistochemistry, only little expression of PrP c , which was mainly confined to KCs, was detected in normal skin. In contrast, in inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis and contact dermatitis, PrP c  was strongly present on both KCs and infiltrating mononuclear cells. Strong PrP c  expression was also observed in squamous cell carcinomas and viral warts whereas basal cell carcinomas were mostly negative. In mucous membranes of the upper digestive tract and the genital region, distinct PrP c  expression by basal squamous epithelial cells was a constant feature. In tissue culture, primary KCs constitutively expressed PrP c  mRNA and protein. Exposure of these cells to transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b1 or interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 led to an increase of PrP c  protein expression. The presence of PrP c  on epithelial cells of skin and mucous membranes suggests that these cells represent possible first targets for peripheral infection with prions.",

There is a lack of genotype-driven therapies for over 50% of patients. TRPM1 (transient receptor potential melastatin 1), a nonspecific cation channel, is mainly expressed in retinal bipolar neurons and skin. Nonetheless, the function of TRPM1 in melanoma progression is poorly understood. \n           \n           \n             Objectives \n             We investigated the association between TRPM1 and acral melanoma progression and revealed the molecular mechanisms by which TRPM1 promotes tumor progression and malignancy. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             TRPM1 expression and CaMKII phosphorylation in tumor specimens were tested by immunohistochemistry analysis and scored by two independent investigators. The functions of TRPM1 and CaMKII were assessed using loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches and examined by western blotting, colony formation, cell migration and invasion, and xenograft tumor growth assays. The effects of a CaMKII inhibitor, KN93, were evaluated using both  in vitro  cell and  in vivo  xenograft mouse models. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             We revealed that TRPM1 protein expression was positively associated with tumor progression and shorter survival in patients with acral melanoma. TRPM1 promoted AKT activation and the colony formation, cell mobility, and xenograft tumor growth of melanoma cells. TRPM1 elevated cytosolic Ca 2+  levels and activated CaMKII\u03b4 (Ca 2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II\u03b4) to promote the CaMKII\u03b4/AKT interaction and AKT activation. The functions of TRPM1 in melanoma cells were suppressed by a CaMKII inhibitor, KN93. Significant upregulation of phospho-CaMKII levels in acral melanomas was related to increased expression of TRPM1. An acral melanoma cell line with high expression of TRPM1, CA11, was isolated from a patient to show the anti-tumor activity of KN93  in vitro  and  in vivo . \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             TRPM1 promotes tumor progression and malignancy in acral melanoma by activating the Ca 2+/ CaMKII\u03b4/AKT pathway. CaMKII inhibition may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating acral melanomas with high expression of TRPM1.",

    "document": "Burden of Arrhythmias in Epilepsy Patients: A Nationwide Inpatient Analysis of 1.4 Million Hospitalizations in the United States\nArrhythmias have been one of the common complications in epilepsy patients and have also been the reason for death.\u00a0However, limited data exist about the burden and outcomes of arrhythmias by subtypes in epilepsy. Our study aims at evaluating the burden and differences in outcomes of various subtypes of arrhythmias in epilepsy patient population. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2014 was examined for epilepsy and arrhythmias related discharges using appropriate International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. The frequency of arrhythmias, gender differences in arrhythmia\u00a0by subtypes, in-hospital outcomes and mortality predictors was analyzed. A total of 1,424,320 weighted epilepsy patients was determined and included in this study. Around\u00a023.9% (n =277,230) patients had cardiac arrhythmias. The most frequent arrhythmias in the descending frequency were: atrial fibrillation (AFib) 9.7%, other unspecified causes 7.3%, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) 1.4%, bundle branch block (BBB) 1.2%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) 1%.\u00a0Males were more predisposed to cardiac arrhythmias compared to females (OR [odds ratio]: 1.1, p <0.001). The prevalence\u00a0of most subtypes arrhythmias was higher in males. Arrhythmias were present in nearly a quarter of patients with epilepsy. Life threatening arrhythmias were more common in male patients. The length of stay (LOS) and mortality were significantly higher in epilepsy patients with arrhythmia. It is imperative to develop early diagnosis and prompt therapeutic measures to reduce this burden and poor outcomes due to concomitant arrhythmias in epilepsy patients.",

    "question": "Symptoms: My brother plagued by joint pain. He uses eye-tracking software to use the computer because his wrists hurt too much to type. He has been on crutches for 4 months after injuring his ankle from jogging. He bought a self-driving car for Uber because his knees hurt too much to use the pedals. He is motivated and wants to do many things were it not for the pain in his body.\n\nStats: 27M , 5'11 tall , 160lbs , white / nonhispanic, little to no alcohol, no drug use, Minnesota, USA, no prescription medications, bowels normal.\n\nBefore it started: Brother was a black-belt in tea-kwon-do, an extremely gifted violinist and piano player, and has always been extremely physically active. He would practice for hours per day, perfecting his arts. Starting suddenly in middle school, he started experiencing tendon injuries (overuse injuries, tendonitis) that eventually caused him to give up on TKD and piano. First he had to stop playing piano because of his wrists. The doctors said it must be from riding too much bike. Next his ankles from too much jogging. His shoulder literally fell out of its socket during an improv class and then every night while he slept - he's had 2 surgeries to correct that. He was a teenager when this started, now he can't drive normaly because his knees hurt too badly. He still does, he finds workarounds. There is never a specific injury and he's not clumsy, it just starts hurting from using. He loves jogging, juggling, swimming on a daily basis when he's not in pain, he is naturally extremely athletic and active.\n\nNow: He is 27, in the healthy BMI range, hair is much thinner than mine, seems a bit grey and pale and emotionally flat all the time like he's dragging himself through life. He eats healthy, is currently on a low-oxalate diet and takes a high-quality multi and fish oil daily (Dr's. Best brand).\nTests and attempts to control: Nothing shows on MRIs, x-rays or arthritis tests. His fingers and joints do not appear hypermobile to to doctors. Doctors and family have totally given up, and kind of see him as a failure, and they believe it's purely psychological. I (big brother) am about to order a gamut of blood tests - everything I can think of.\n\nDocs told my wife the same thing about her skin conditions, fatigue, and other myriad of symptoms and I didn't give up on her (even after she had) - turned out she had thyroid cancer, and removing it fixed psoriasis and all, almost overnight. Not giving up on my brother this easy.\n\nUPDATE: I just got a copy of his \u201chealthy\u201d lab reports from 2 years ago and am about to lose my sh*t. His WBC was out of range (3.6k), RBC was low (4.67k), bilirubin was high (1.9), co2 was 130\u2026 whatever rheumatologist told a 25 year old with chronic fatigue, pain, tremors, and injuries that his numbers matching that of a chemo patient was perfectly fine potentially caused years of unnecessary suffering. They didn\u2019t test for Lyme or celiac. ANA and Rheum were normal.

Results have been at best, moderately good and at worst a failure. The evidence for non-infammatory degenerative processes alone as the cause of tendinopathy is surprisingly weak.

We searched the PubMed database and reviewed the articles published until June 2011. Articles related to the D-dimer and VTE were considered to write this paper. Many factors play a key role in changing the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer testing, including the extent of thrombosis and fibrinolytic activity, duration of symptoms, anticoagulant therapy, comorbidity due to surgical or medical illnesses, inflammatory diseases, cancer, elderly age, pregnancy and the postpartum period, and previous VTE. Many previous studies have shown that the D-dimer test is highly sensitive (>95%) in acute deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, usually with a cut-off value of 500 \u03bcg FEU/l, which reasonably rules out acute VTE, particularly in patients with low clinical probability (LCP) or intermediate clinical probability. Patients with high D-dimer levels upon presentation may prompt a more intense diagnostic approach, irrespective of pretest probability. Studies performed after a negative D-dimer for 3 months proved the high negative predictive value (NPV) of D-dimer testing together with LCP in patients with suspected VTE. Among oncology patients, D-dimer testing has the highest sensitivity and NPV in excluding VTE. The new cutoff values of D-dimer testing were analyzed in a recent prospective study of pregnant women; they are 286 ng DDU/ml, 457 ng DDU/ml, and 644 ng DDU/ml for the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively.",

Mature fat did not inhibit preadipocyte replication within the 6-d period studied. Preadipocyte differentiation, as assessed by both cytoplasmic lipid accretion and an increase in glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity, was significantly stimulated by the presence of mature fat tissue or isolated adipocytes. The proportion of cells containing visible lipid droplets by oil red O staining was 47 +/- 10 to 58 +/- 10% (depending on the site of origin of the preadipocytes) when cocultured with mature fat compared with less than 1 to 2 +/- 1% when cultured in medium alone, while GPDH activity was 344 +/- 9 compared with 43 +/- 3 nM NADH/min per mg protein, respectively.

Call me J. Several years ago, in January of 2013, I contracted an extremely serious skin infection on both feet. As in, I had to spend several days in the hospital getting intravenous antibiotics. They were never able to figure out what it was or where it came from, only that it wasn't impetigo or diabetes, and the bacteria itself was, and I quote, \"an unholy amalgamation of staph and strep.\" I had this condition until June of 2013.\n\nAll fairly normal, right? Except here's the rub: it never hurt. Never. My left foot was three times its usual size, my toes are permanently misshapen on both feet and one of my toes actually turned purple, but it never hurt even a little. (One reason it got so bad-- I didn't realize how bad it really was.) What it did do was itch, so badly, in a way I've never felt anything itch before or since. It was... Pleasurable to scratch it, or pour searing hot water on it.\n\nAnyway, what's that to do with my post? Not long after that, I started having this pain in my legs. See, when I was younger, I would wake up from nightmares and my legs would burn. Like ten or twenty acid needles slamming into my knees. But then after I had this skin infection, that leg burning started happening every time I woke up during the night-- which is often, given the sleep apnea-- and then it started happening during the day. Now, once a day or so, I will get that stabby-acid-burny feeling on my thighs.\n\nNotice I said thighs. See, the pain has gradually been spreading-- mostly upwards. Instead of being centered on my knees, now it's centered on my thighs, and even as high as my hip bones. I discovered that denim, or any similarly rough fabric, made the pain much, much worse, so I stopped wearing it, but it hasn't eliminated the issue entirely.\n\nAnd now, the inevitable has happened. It has reached my genitals.\n\nGod, I cannot explain to you how awful this is. If anything touches my outer labia, it will *burn.* Just my outer labia, mind, and the crease between my thighs and my pubes. No internal burning, and nothing on the mons pubis or however it's spelled- the upper bit. But there are four or five distinct spots on my skin that will just burn, on and off for around thirty minutes or until I can sufficiently distract myself-- which is hard to do, say, at work. I've examined myself thoroughly, and there's no marks, no swelling, no discoloration. It looks entirely normal-- it just hurts so, so badly. Touching my skin or applying pressure by, say, squeezing my thighs together relieves the pain for a few moments, but it always comes back, just like it did on my thighs.\n\nPlease. I just want this to stop. The labia pain has only been happening for a few days and I already cried for thirty minutes today, begging whatever deity was listening to just let it end. I don't know if you guys can tell me what's wrong, but does anyone have any tips on how to make this better?

In fact, she and I (m, 27, 150lbs, 5\u201911\u201d, Caucasian, USA, no medical issues) eat almost entirely identically since we\u2019re never apart. \n\nTo help her on her weight loss journey, we decided to go keto in 2020, we were keto from Jan 202 thru September to no avail. We were completely faithful to the diet, we increased our exercise, I enjoyed tangible results, she lost roughly 10lbs in 9 months (around 310lbs, down from 320lbs). It was at this point that we decided to start the insurance process to get her approved for vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG).\n\nIn October, however, and although none of her doctors are 100% sure what she suffered from, she fell ill. They believe it to have been gastroparesis. She was regularly admitted to the hospital for the next few months. During this time, her weight peaked at nearly 340lbs, despite throwing up more than 20 times per day. This experience lasted through January 2021. I can\u2019t speak to her experience, but it was the worst experience of my life since I was powerless to help. \n\nFinally, by February, her episodes seemed to have been subsiding; we were thrilled to finally be getting her VSG through UCI. \n\nAt the start of her pre-op diet, she weighed 300lbs. She began the pre-op diet of exclusively Premiere Protein shakes for the first 14 day of March 2021. She was consuming less than 500 calories per day. She didn\u2019t even lose 5lbs. For the first two weeks post-op, she was similarly constrained to 3 premiere protein shakes per day (500 calories). After 4 weeks of only drinking 3 protein shakes per day, she had dropped 10lbs down to 290. At 2 weeks post-op, her nutritionist told her the weight would eventually fall so long as she adhered to the diet. They suggested she press forward with the recommended diet\u2014moving to soft foods\u2014because eventually her body would start rejecting the protein shakes. She has remained faithful to eating soft foods and drinking protein shakes since. There is no way my wife is consuming more than an average of 1,000 calories per day. Additionally, we walk 5,000+ steps every day at the nutritionist\u2019s behest. \n\nShe has scheduled appointments with endocrinologists, but they\u2019re not immediate. Her thyroid has been tested and is fine. The UCI bariatric doctors have not responded to her. The nurses defer her calls to the nutritionists. The nutritionists clearly don\u2019t believe she\u2019s been faithful to her diet. They keep moving the goalposts: \u201cif 5,000 steps a day isn\u2019t working, do 10,000.\u201d\n\nWhat could possibly be wrong with her that she is incapable of losing weight? \n\nI\u2019m so tired and frustrated of hearing, \u201ccalories in, calories out.\u201d It\u2019s bullshit. Something is missing. My wife isn\u2019t fat because she over-eats; she barely eats at all. She\u2019s losing it and we\u2019re pretty desperate to find answers. Thank you.\n\nEdit: wanted to thank everyone who has put forth a thoughtful post or suggestion I really appreciate it. You\u2019ve given us a lot of things to look into or bring up with the doctors. \n\nI also wanted to address something that maybe wasn\u2019t clear in my original post. Four weeks ago, my wife did in fact have VSG, vertical sleeve gastrectomy. They removed 85% of her stomach, her cheating or sneaking food while not impossible is highly unlikely given that she has a very hard time with the three protein shakes a day she has been having. Everything hurts going down. \n\nMoreover I wanted to copy paste more information for the people who think she must be cheating, which again, while not impossible would be very difficult. \n\nMy wife and I work from home, we wake up, go to our office in the house, eat our meals together, run errands together, and go to sleep. \n\nWe are rarely apart because of the fact that we both work from home. \n\nShe also doesn\u2019t drive because of issues with vertigo. I drive everywhere and have to take her to all her appointments and errands. I either grocery shop alone or we do it together. She can\u2019t drive out to get food to cheat. \n\nWe also have security cameras at our front door, our gate, and In our kitchen because of the entry points to our house our whole kitchen is covered by the views of the cameras from the inside. We checked the cameras to see if she was sleep walking or sleep eating, she isn\u2019t. \n\nShe isn\u2019t getting food delivered (again cameras in the front of the house), plus we have dogs that go nuts any time someone comes over, and a guard gate who calls and has an entry log when someone who isn\u2019t a resident comes through the gate. \n\nAnd last but not least, she had vertical sleeve gastrectomy. They cut out 85% of her stomach. For the 4 weeks since the surgery she has been consuming 3 premier protein shakes a day plus multivitamins. She can literally only have a tablespoon at a time of liquids. \n\nI hope people understand. I wouldn\u2019t have posted here if I thought my wife being dishonest about what she was consuming was a legitimate option. She is absolutely despondent because she is doing everything the doctors have told her to no avail.",

    "response": "Obesity is a very complex process. Calories in and calories out is an oversimplification though fundamentally this is true.\n\nIn terms of the trajectory of her weight loss, she actually seems to be responding appropriately. For example, losing 5 pounds in 14 days is about expected assuming she burns a net negative of ~1750 calories daily . By 4 weeks, she lost 10 pounds which again is exactly expected if she is burning a net negative of 1750 calories per day.\n\nNow, the counter argument you probably have is that there is no way she is only net negative 2000 calories daily when she's 300 pounds and she does 5000 steps daily. The reason is a phenomenon that she is mostly unable to control. As you begin a negative caloric deficit, your body will make subtle changes to counter that effect. This can be something as obvious as slowing your metabolism to something as subtle as behavioral changes such as reducing the amount of movement/activity the individual does. As far as the body is concerned, if you are at a negative deficit, you are starving and so the body will make changes to conserve calories.\n\nAs long as she continues to have negative caloric balance, she will continue to lose weight. However, it is physiologically extremely difficult (borderline impossible) to lose significantly more than the rate she is losing now. To give you an example, to lose 10 pounds every 2 weeks, you would need to burn in excess of 2500 calories daily. If you eat 500 calories a day only, then it would be 3000 calories daily. This would border on the upper limit of what is plausible even for a severely obese individual (and would be impossible for someone lighter without heavy exercise). On that of that,  you would need to put in additional effort to counter the compensatory metabolic and behavioral changes to \"starving\".\n\nTLDR: She is losing weight appropriately. Losing about 1 pound every 3 days is completely appropriate. That's 10 pounds every month, 30 pounds in 3 months or 60 pounds in half a year. At some point, she will not be able to burn enough net calories due to her lighter weight even with just a low caloric diet."

    "question": "15M, 166 cm, 84 kg(??), 11 months of Ear Infection , currently drinking Amoxiclav \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm in dire need of your advice. I might also vent throughout the post because I feel frustrated at their superstitions over health.\n\nI was washing my face when a small water droplet entered my right ear in March. I tried getting it out by jumping with my head tilted to the right but to no avail. I just ignored it since it really didn't bothered me much and didn't really changed my hearing, comparing when pool water is stuck at my ears when swimming.  Some days after, I felt some clogging in my ears and there would be pain occasionally. I also feel a clogging, deep in my nose but I can still breathe. I decided not to tell to wait it out if it gets better. A week later, it isn't gone so I told my mum about it.\n\nThen she and my father goes ranting about me sticking a lot of things in my ears, me bathing at night (this BS is the one I'm most frustrated about) and that I don't eat enough fruits, not getting enough sleep, etc. This is one of the main reasons I'm not open to them about anything and the reason why I don't tell them easily about the things I feel. Combine this with the fact that they believe more in superstition than modern medicine and they assume that they know everything. What can I expect, they are Asians. Our country has strict policies regarding COVID and as a minor, I can't go out without a legal-aged companion. I have to be accompanied by my mum.\n\nShe wanted me to go to an EMT doctor but there was none in our area. She somehow trusts more of an EMT doc than a general doc, and I understand her. We instead went to a local doctor (idk his specialty, maybe general health). I was prescribed Amoxiclav for 10 days, 3 a day. After a follow up check up, the doctor said my ears were better but I wasn't feeling it. Either way, he prescribed another 10 days of Amoxiclav. My mum also applied folk meds, e.g. *Suob* (hot steam inhalation with salt) and essential oils (I'm tired of this horsecrap). When I was almost finished with my 2nd batch of Amoxiclav, I was feeling better. I told my mum that we had to go back for a follow up check up but then she says that I have been taking antibiotics for too long and she says that I should just sleep more and don't bathe during the night. I lost my conviction to tell her what I was feeling because I was thinking that if I force it to her, she would just be angry and she'll just shrug me off. I also thought that the infection will just go away, but it didn't. The clogging was still there and the pain still goes periodically. I eventually acquired tinnitus, though the ringing is not as loud. However, overtime, the tinnitus got worse but it isn't loud. \n\nI was having train of thoughts about my parents and how unfortunate me and my brother to have parents who are very superstitious (but I recognize that they love me and I never felt I was abused. They give us a comfortable life and I love them. However, they are not the kind that listens to anything that contradicts them). I was also having some suicidal thoughts because their assumption that they know more about me more than myself really angers me. Though, I really didn't had the plan to carry anything out and I just kept telling myself that if this worsens, e.g. I loss hearing or die of infection, it's their fault and not mine.  \n\nBy December 20, I finally gathered the courage and told her. I told her that the infection never really went away and I hold that info back to her because she said that I was drinking too much antibiotics. She said why didn't I tell her earlier etc. and I didn't respond lolz\n\nAnyway we went again to the same doctor and he prescribed me with Cephalexin with Paracetamol for 10 days, 3 a day. I assumed that he gave me Cephalexin instead of Amoxiclav because the infection has grown resistant to the Amoxiclav (this is basic biology).\n\nAfter the check up, I was again sermoned that I should not bathe at night and that I should sleep early. I was also told to eat more fruits. I was told to inhale the steam  again and applied a cooling essential oil ointment in my forehead and back of the ears. I know the placebo of cooling ointments and that steam inhalation won't help my ear infection. I told her that applying ointments around my head won't help. However, she kept insisting.\n\nIt is also known in our household that I don't believe in traditional medical superstitions. They keep arguing that people back then don't have medicine and they still lived. I can easily counter this by saying that life expectancy was low and the mortality rates are higher back then, however, if I answer them back, they'll feel disrespected and be angry and smack me. They also argue that they know more because it's their experience. However,  when I keep asking them how these superstitions work, they'll just say \" don't question it\" and then be angry at me. This is especially true when I ask them the correlation between bathing at night and acquiring this infection. \n\nMidway in my course through Cephalexin (Dec. 27), we went to an EMT doctor and the doctor prescribed Amoxiclav and Paracetamol, 3 a day for 10 days. I wasn't able to tell the doctor about my past Amoxiclav intake and I was telling my mum to tell the doctor that I already took Amoxiclav back in March, but then she tells me that the EMT doc is different. I tried telling her again but to no avail. I just shut my self up. I expected her to know basic antibiotic resistance (since she knows everything \ud83d\ude44) but wtf no. \n\nI didn't know what to do but I finished my Cephalexin on that day and started Amoxiclav again the day after that. I've been drinking Amoxiclav until now. We're ought to return in Wednesday this week for a follow up check up at the EMT doctor. But then she worries again that I am taking too much antibiotics and tells me that steam inhalation and ointments will work better.\n\nI just don't know what to do. Should I be taking Cephalexin? What should I tell to my mum? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't get my parents wrong, I know that they're doing it out of love. But it's toxic.  Almost all Asian parents are like that lol",
    "document": "Efficacy of Boric Acid as a Treatment of Choice for Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media and Its Ototoxicity\nChronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is one of the most common chronic infectious diseases worldwide, especially affecting children. The patients or the parents of the affected children are often worried about the cost of medical visits, prescription medicines, or inconsistently effective medication. The complications of CSOM have been greatly reduced because of the development of antibiotics; however, the irrational use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of organisms resistant to the commonly used drugs. Owing to the increase in antibiotic resistance, the development of new treatments that will efficiently eradicate infectious microorganisms has become imperative. Boric acid solutions are effective in the treatment of CSOM because of their acidic effect. Various databases, such as the PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and SciELO, were searched for references related to the efficacy of boric acid in the treatment of mucosal CSOM, as well as its ototoxicity. The search revealed that boric acid is relatively effective in treating CSOM, especially at a high concentration. Boric acid in distilled water was found safe in animal studies. However, the ototoxicity of boric acid concentrations higher than 4% needs further evaluation, considering the effectivity of boric acid at high concentrations.",

However, recent animal studies indicate that antipsychotics, the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia patients, may also contribute to brain tissue volume decrement. Because antipsychotics are prescribed for long periods for schizophrenia patients and have increasingly widespread use in other psychiatric disorders, it is imperative to determine their long-term effects on the human brain. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             To evaluate relative contributions of 4 potential predictors (illness duration, antipsychotic treatment, illness severity, and substance abuse) of brain volume change. \n           \n           \n             Design \n             Predictors of brain volume changes were assessed prospectively based on multiple informants. \n           \n           \n             Setting \n             Data from the Iowa Longitudinal Study. \n           \n           \n             Patients \n             Two hundred eleven patients with schizophrenia who underwent repeated neuroimaging beginning soon after illness onset, yielding a total of 674 high-resolution magnetic resonance scans.

Longer follow-up correlated with smaller brain tissue volumes and larger cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Greater intensity of antipsychotic treatment was associated with indicators of generalized and specific brain tissue reduction after controlling for effects of the other 3 predictors. More antipsychotic treatment was associated with smaller gray matter volumes. Progressive decrement in white matter volume was most evident among patients who received more antipsychotic treatment. Illness severity had relatively modest correlations with tissue volume reduction, and alcohol/illicit drug misuse had no significant associations when effects of the other variables were adjusted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Viewed together with data from animal studies, our study suggests that antipsychotics have a subtle but measurable influence on brain tissue loss over time, suggesting the importance of careful risk-benefit review of dosage and duration of treatment as well as their off-label use.",

    "question": "I am a 33 year old male and generally very healthy and athletic. A couple of years ago back in 2019, I experienced some mild chest pain because of which I got an ECG done. At that time, it turned out to be something related to acid reflux which was causing the pain in my chest and abdomen. So everything related to the heart was normal, except that my ECG showed a first degree AV block. The PR interval was 232ms. (Normal range is 120-200ms)\n\nMy primary care provider told me that it's nothing to worry about, it is a benign condition and common in athletes. He said nothing needed to be done and no treatment was necessary. \n\nIt's been 2 years now and I feel like my PCP is too lax about a follow up. In these 2 years, I have asked him 3 or 4 times regarding getting a follow up ECG to check if the 1st degree AV block isn't progressing to anything serious. But everytime all he says is \"it's not needed\". \n\nI have a crazy anxiety about a heart condition as heart disease runs through my family (my grandfather, my dad, my uncle all of them had it). My grandfather died of a sudden cardiac arrest and my father died of a heart attack. My PCP knows about this and still he doesn't seem to care. \n\nOn top of that, I recently saw a 29-year old soccer player (Christian Eriksen) get a sudden cardiac arrest during the Euro 2021 tournament and almost die on the pitch.

However, the clinical significance of first-degree AVB has not been evaluated in patients with stable coronary heart disease. We investigated whether first-degree AVB is associated with heart failure (HF) and mortality in a prospective cohort study of outpatients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). \n           \n           \n             Methods and results \n             We measured the P\u2013R interval in 938 patients with stable CAD and classified them into those with (P\u2013R interval \u2265220 ms) and without (P\u2013R interval <220 ms) first-degree AVB. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for HF hospitalization and all-cause mortality. During 5 years of follow-up, there were 123 hospitalizations for HF and 285 deaths. Compared with patients who had normal atrioventricular conduction, those with first-degree AVB were at increased risk for HF hospitalization (age-adjusted HR 2.33: 95% CI 1.49\u20133.65;  P = 0.0002), mortality [age-adjusted HR 1.58; 95% CI (1.13\u20132.20);  P  = 0.008], cardiovascular (CV) mortality [age-adjusted HR 2.33; 95% CI (1.28\u20134.22);  P = 0.005], and the combined endpoint of HF hospitalization or CV mortality (age-adjusted HR 2.43: 95% CI 1.64\u20133.61;  P  \u2264 0.0001). These associations persisted after multivariable adjustment for heart rate, medication use, ischaemic burden, and QRS duration. Adjustment for left ventricular systolic and diastolic function partially attenuated the effect, but first-degree AVB remained associated with the combined endpoint of HF or CV death (HR 1.61, CI 1.02\u20132.54;  P = 0.04). \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             In a large cohort of patients with stable coronary artery disease, first-degree AVB is associated with HF and death.",

Dysfunction of the nervous system, as manifested by neural plastic changes in primary sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system (peripheral sensitization) and spinal cord and brain stem neurons in the central nervous system (central sensitization) will result in chronic pain and itch. Importantly, these diseases also result from immune dysfunction, since inflammatory mediators can directly activate or sensitize nociceptive and pruriceptive neurons in the peripheral and central nervous system, leading to pain and itch hypersensitivity. In this mini-review, I discuss the roles of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) ion channel, and Nav1.7 sodium channel in regulating itch and inflammation, with special emphasis of neuronal TLR signaling and the interaction of TLR7 and TRPA1. Chronic pain and chronic itch are debilitating diseases and dramatically impact the life quality of patients. Targeting TLRs for the control of inflammation, neuroinflammation (inflammation restricted in the nervous system), and hyperexcitability of nociceptors and pruriceptors will lead to new therapeutics for the relief of chronic pain and chronic itch. Finally, given the shared mechanisms among chronic cough, chronic pain, and chronic itch and the demonstrated efficacy of the neuropathic pain drug gabapentin in treating chronic cough, novel therapeutics targeting TRPA1, Nav1.7, and TLRs may also help to alleviate refractory cough via modulating neuron-immune interaction.",

Incident type 2 diabetes was identified at three follow-up examinations (2002\u20132003, 2004\u20132005, and 2005\u20132007) as fasting glucose >126 mg/dl, self-reported type 2 diabetes, or use of diabetes medication. Metabolic syndrome (and components) was defined by National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI for type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and metabolic syndrome components were estimated, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and dietary confounders. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS \n             At least daily consumption of diet soda was associated with a 36% greater relative risk of incident metabolic syndrome and a 67% greater relative risk of incident type 2 diabetes compared with nonconsumption (HR 1.36 [95% CI 1.11\u20131.66] for metabolic syndrome and 1.67 [1.27\u20132.20] for type 2 diabetes). Of metabolic syndrome components, only high waist circumference (men \u2265102 cm and women \u226588 cm) and high fasting glucose (\u2265100 mg/dl) were prospectively associated with diet soda consumption. Associations between diet soda consumption and type 2 diabetes were independent of baseline measures of adiposity or changes in these measures, whereas associations between diet soda and metabolic syndrome were not independent of these factors. \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSIONS \n             Although these observational data cannot establish causality, consumption of diet soda at least daily was associated with significantly greater risks of select incident metabolic syndrome components and type 2 diabetes.",

    "question": "Hi,\n\nI apologize, this is a pretty large post with a lot of symptoms. I'm a 29 year old male who quit smoking 18 months ago, and quit vaping 7 months ago. I have had a variety of health issues since September 2019:\n\n**September 2019:** Diagnosed with bacterial prostatitis, 2 weeks ciprofloxacin\n\n**April 2020:** Diagnosed with bacterial prostatitis, 4 weeks ofloxacin\n\n**May 2020:** Since finishing my  course of antibiotics, I started experiencing issues with my right wrist. I can describe this wrist pain as a pain inside the underarm area of my wrist, it felt like some constriction that reduced my ability to grip tightly). A few weeks later the same feelings were mimicked in my left wrist. I couldn't grip a spoon at one stage. I had occasional numbness in my ring finger and middle finger. On my left hand, the 'muscle' tissue that connects to my wrist and shifts as I move my thumb around  (C6?) seemed to have pulled (it looked like the muscle was hanging and had dislodged). My forearms started feeling significant strain.\n\n**September 2020:** To my relief, symptoms had largely subsided after significant rest period of 1 month.\n\n**October 2020:** I started having issues again running through my entire left and right arm. Both forearms felt tenderness, with the same feeling of tightness inside my wrists, predominantly on my left wrist.\n\n**November 2020:** Symptoms in my arms persisted, with forearm tiredness and a pain I lost sleep occasionally from discomfort on the left side of my body, specifically around my left scapula (this felt like a type of pain under my muscle, I suspected it felt like it was nerve related \\[ulnar nerve?\\]). [Please see this uploaded image]( i've marked where I felt consistent discomfort that prevented me from sleeping properly. I notice that I am constantly out of breath whenever I walk up the stairs or exert almost any effort, which I find alarming. I also notice I have a small, constant pressure on the right side of my chest, around my pectoral area ([see this image]( I immediately quit vaping.\n\n**December 2020:** I go to the doctor as symptoms did not subside after significant rest. I consult with the doctor who mentioned it could be tendinitis of the arms (forearm tiredness were the dominant pain for me at the time) and that I should rest. We also scheduled an appointment for February to remove a suspected cyst that has been growing just below my neck muscle (trapezius I believe, see [this image](\n\n**February 2021:** I have the suspected cyst removed. It ended up being a benign schwannoma - the surgeon removed this on the spot.\n\n**March 2021:** Forearm tiredness returns with bicep tiredness on both arms. I suspected this was posture related and overuse (desk job). I converted to a standing desk and started going to physiotherapy. I have flareups in pain that feel like they're inside my elbow (some pressure on my funny bone, both my left and right elbow).\n\n**May 2021:** I start losing sleep again because of the pain that runs through what I believe is my ulnar nerve. It feels as if I need to constantly \"stretch\" the muscles above my lats (latissimus dorsi \\[sp.\\]) to get some relief. This pain only presents on the left side of my body. My upper back also starts feeling like I have some burning/radiating pain sensation that comes out of my spine, in a diamond shape. I notice that the burning/radiating pain sensation also extends (and is quite literally connected) to the pains running down the left side of my body. [See this image for clarity]( \\- I would identify the back areas as T1-T2-T3-T4. To get relief from the \"diamond-shaped\" radiating pain, I squeeze my shoulder blades together intensely for a few seconds at a time. This can cause tingling in my arms if done for too long. The diamond shaped area on my upper back feels like its emitting a lot of heat.  I can also gain temporary relief by tucking my chin into my chest (as deep as possible). Elbow pain, wrist tightness and grip weakness all persist in both arms and hands.\n\n**June 2020:** Symptoms persist and having changed doctor, my new doctor reads my medical history, then phones me to send me to a do a chest x-ray. Issues from May 2020 persist intermittently.\n\n**My main questions:**\n\n1. Why did my doctor send me to a chest x-ray when he **did not** **know** about my chest pain and back pain (I am sure this was not in my medical records). I'm glad this new GP has decided to tell me something other than \"its tennis elbow\", but it has made me worry over the weekend. Notable to mention is that I've not noticed any real weight loss - I'm overweight. I will get the X-ray results on Tuesday.\n2. Do my symptoms present themselves as something like a Pancoast tumor would? And If the x-ray shows nothing, should I be asking for a CT scan? I understand CT scans can pick up smaller lesions, but I'm not sure if its necessary if the X-ray shows nothing.\n3. Based on my symptoms, what should my doctor and I be exploring? Tightness in both wrists, grip weakness, numbness in left ring finger and middle finger, shape pain inside my elbows, occasional diamond-shaped radiating back pain, and a painful pressure on my chest all present themselves as symptoms. I will add here that I strongly believe my sitting posture is poor, and that I do feel my shoulders roll forward by default, as well as my neck extending forward while I work. Since converting to a standing desk, my diamond-shaped back pain only presents itself if I spend most of the week sat down instead of standing up (as proved by this week). My physiotherapist also mentions to me that my shoulder areas need release as some areas of my upper body are overcompensating my default movements.\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you so much for reading through. I really would appreciate a response! If you require any clarification I'd be happy to help. Thanks again!\n\nEDIT: The X-ray showed no abnormalities and I've been referred to a neurologist. As this might take a while, any advice or comments are greatly appreciated.",
    "document": "Fluoroquinolone-induced serious, persistent, multisymptom adverse effects\nWe present a case series of four previously healthy, employed adults without significant prior medical history in each of whom symptoms developed while on fluoroquinolones (FQs), with progression that continued following discontinuation evolving to a severe, disabling multisymptom profile variably involving tendinopathy, muscle weakness, peripheral neuropathy, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorder, cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric disturbance. Physicians and patients should be alert to the potential for FQ-induced severe disabling multisymptom pathology that may persist and progress following FQ use.

    "response": "Didn't have time to read everything in detail but a couple initial thoughts:\n\nFluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are known to have tendonitis as a side effect. While the wrist would be an unusual place for this to present, I wonder if that might be a factor in your initial symptoms. \n\nYour age along makes a lung cancer very unlikely. A chest xray doesn't hurt to start with as far as a diagnostic workup. Avoiding the radiation of a CT scan would be recommended unless things continue to progress and the chest xray is not helpful.\n\nYour symptoms sound radicular in nature and make me wonder about nerve compression from something like thoracic outlet syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, or degenerative changes in the neck (not particularly common at 29 but possible). \n\nNote: Not a neurologist or musculoskeletal specialist, however, so perhaps someone with more expertise could chime in."

    "question": "So I have been having the hardest year of my life with my current husband with whom I have been with for a total of 7 years. We met in our mid twenties and generally had a pretty happy relationship. Things started to go south slowly in mid 2017 with the pressure of getting engaged, planning a wedding and dealing with our difficult and dysfunctional families. In addition we were also starting our careers, living in a HCOL area and generally figuring out adulthood. We are also two very different people who came to blows over many differences and were generally poor with conflict resolution.\n\nWe had our lows but would always find a way out and be happy again.\n\nAt the start of this year, however, things seem to slowly unravel. My husband suddenly started getting panic attacks this January. Seeing as he was someone who never had anxiety or panic attacks, he was very disturbed by this. He genuinely thought he was dying, and had breakdowns. I took him to the ER, and called the EMTs multiple times at 3 am as he would wake up in a panic saying he was dying. They all cleared him saying he was healthy.\n\nAround March he went to a GP for a checkup who looked at his EKG, read it incorrectly and told him he was dying. Within 30 minutes he called my husband back and said actually he made an error and everything was normal. This seemed to have really spooked my husband to the core. After that for the next few weeks he thought he had heart troubles and would not listen to me as I tried to reason with him.\n\nI finally had him visit a cardiologist who indeed confirmed his heart was fine. We then went back to his GP who said that my husband was suffering from extreme stress and anxiety and needed to be put on medication. She prescribed him 10 mg Lexapro. The Lexapro was a god sent in the sense that it finally erased his panic attacks and shortness of breath. Things seem to finally slowly calm down and go back to normal.\n\nA few weeks on Lexapro I started to notice slight changes in his personality. Suddenly he was colder and more distant. The soft, warm sweetness of his personality was replaced by coldness and anger. Now that his panic attacks and anxiety were gone, suddenly everything else was wrong. He said he hated his job that he previously loved and excelled at. He said he was bored and wanted to quit to join the police academy or start his own business, His family and I cautioned him that he needed to not act suddenly and think things through. Anything we said that wasn't affirmative was met with resistance and anger.\n\nHe also started drinking heavily. While my husband has always liked to drink, his daily 2 glasses of wine have now turned into a bottle of wine per night. He also goes out with his friends and gets blasted drunk and parties and bar hops until 2- 3 am in the morning. When I tell him he needs to come home earlier, he gets mean and aggressive and tells me to stop being a fun killer!\n\nSuddenly I am his enemy no.1. He seems to have re-written our entire story where everything about our relationship and marriage is wrong. He hates and resents me for the hurt I have caused him and says he feels trapped and caged. He screams at me, yells at me and has scary episodes. For example, if he comes home at 2 am after bar hopping and I say anything about him staying out too late, he will walk into the kitchen, grab a bottle of wine say he is getting out of here and go lock himself in our car!!\n\nHe has also started sexting and chatting and calling with random women from hook up apps. I discovered him receiving nudes from a woman a month ago. When I confronted him about it he screamed at me that he wanted a divorce and ran away to stay with his parents. Another time when I tried to confront him again he screamed at me, took his bottle of wine and locked himself out side in our car. When I tried to go outside and get him to come inside and stalk to me like a normal person, he screamed at me and drove off drunk into the night at 3 am. He did not return home until an hour later.\n\nRecently I discovered that he has been having sex with hookers in hotel rooms. He has recently started not coming home or coming home late after work. He always stays at the office until 3- 4 am and sexts chats and sends nude selfies to random women based on what I have seen on his phone.\n\nIf he does come home, he will stay up till 3 am by himself watching a movie and drinking.\n\nOccasionally he will seem to have a moment of clarity, apologize profusely and tell me he doesn't know what he is doing. He gets these extreme rushes of emotions and he cant seem to control himself. The rest of the time when I bring up that something isn't normal he says I am the enemy and he hates me and I need to leave him alone and throws a tantrum and runs away.\n\nI am at my wits end. I do not know what is going on with him. He is an asshole or is he suffering from some mental health issue?\n\nTLDR; My 31 year old husband has been acting increasingly erratic, aggressive, mean and is cheating on me. I don't know what to do as this all seems very out of character.",
    "document": "Treatment-emergent mania/hypomania in unipolar patients\nObjective \n             The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of treatment-emergent mania/hypomania (TEMH) and to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with major depression experiencing this event during treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and/or interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT). \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Following an algorithm-based protocol, 344 patients with major depression confirmed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV disorders were treated with an SSRI, interpersonal psychotherapy, or their combination for nine months. The emergence of mania/hypomania was carefully monitored throughout the study using the Young Mania Rating Scale and clinical assessment. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Overall, eight patients experienced TEMH. The incidence of this event was 3.0% in patients treated with an SSRI and 0.9% in patients treated with IPT alone. Among patients treated with an SSRI, the difference between sites was higher than expected by chance alone (6.8% at Pisa and 0% at Pittsburgh, p = 0.002). Despite the adoption of an identical protocol at the two sites, some demographic and clinical characteristics of participants may account for this unexpected result. Alternatively, the greater number of episodes and earlier age of onset at the Pittsburgh site suggests that the unipolar course of illness was more clearly established prior to study entry. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             TEMH is an infrequent event, occurring in 2.3% of patients treated for major depression. Nevertheless, its consequences are clinically relevant and require prompt and appropriate therapeutic interventions. For this reason, recognising those patients at risk for such an event is of paramount clinical significance. The observed difference in the incidence of TEMH between the two sites requires further investigation.",
    "response": "First of all, I am sorry that this has been a tough year for you.  It has to be super distressing to see someone you love and care about struggling so much.  Even more so that you are seemingly punished for sharing that concern.\n\nGoing to agree with others who shared impressions of combination of undertreated mental illness and addiction.  I could speculate on diagnoses, but I think that would be of limited utility to you as the concerned party (not to mention unethical).  Agree with med student above that this could be drug-induced mania or an independent mania that is not well-controlled by lexapro.  \n\nHow you have this conversation with him is the difficult part, as you have already identified.  I think you are on the right path in speaking about this in medical terms, and this might be your means to help him seek care.\n\nWhen he is acutely intoxicated is probably not the best time to share your concern.  If you are able to have a conversation with him when he is not drunk - try to do so from a calm but firm place of being really worried about his health.  It can end with \"When can we make an appointment to see GP/Psychiatrist , how can I help this happen?\"  You can also speak to emotions underneath the rage \"I think you are really scared right now, I can tell you are really worried and hurting.\"\n\nNo guarantees he will seek further care, but you can at least know you did your level best.  If he does agree, make sure to tell him beforehand that you intend to share the full scope of his behavior with his physician/treatment provider.  \"I want them to be able to know everything so they can get you the best care.\"\n\nLastly, you can't help anyone else if you aren't caring for yourself.  This sounds pretty stressful and you deserve your own support beyond what we might offer you on reddit.\n\nHe's a lucky to have a caring partner who is willing to go to great lengths to see him well again.   Best of luck in seeing that through."

Southern blotting revealed that at least eight HTLV proviruses were integrated in the chromosomes of MT-2 cells. The genomic structure of these proviruses was analyzed using fragments of cloned HTLV that were specific to gag, pol, env, pXs and U3R genes as probes. We have identified a complete genome of HTLV in MT-2 (non-defective type). However, seven of the eight proviruses had defective genomes. Provirus T2-a contains only the U3R (LTR) of HTLV and T2-b corresponds to the non-defective genome. T2-c possesses only a portion of env, and pXs and U3R. T2-d consists of gag, pol, part of env and U3R. On the other hand, T2-e, f, g and h consist of gag, pXs and U3R. Northern blotting experiments with mRNA from MT-2 cells supported the evidence of amplification of the gag-pXs gene of HTLV. 26S mRNA is considered to be a subgenomic species of 35S RNA. 32S mRNA may represent the T2-d provirus which lacks a portion of env and pXs, while 20S mRNA was a subgenomic species.

    "question": "I was basically lying in bed when suddenly I had a strange ringing in my right ear. Over a few minutes the hearing in that ear seemed to fade out. After a few minutes it came back to normal.\n\nHowever I also went through some of the worst terror I've ever experienced - much worse than what happened earlier in June this year when I suffered SSNHL and was refused steroids. My hearing returned on its own after about week. I guess I got lucky that time. But that experience has created escalating anxiety because what if I were refused steroids again?\n\nLong story short I felt extremely ill and went into a \"twilight\" sort of daze where you are just on the verge of a complete faint but not quite there...an almost peaceful experience if it were not for the horrible anxiety that causes the faint.\n\nI could not sit up properly but I laid down the floor and put my feet up on the bed. This near loss of consciousness lasted for at least 10 minutes and was very concerning because I also experienced sweating, and a fluttering/hollow sensation where I expect to feel a heart beat. I had absolutely no pulse. This lasted for about 45 seconds. I don't even know if I lost consciousness but I do remember the last time I fainted I lost bladder control. I didn't during this episode.

Electronic databases PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO were searched up to 1 July 2019 for peer-reviewed articles recording post-vasectomy pain. We identified 733 publications, screened 559 after removal of duplicates and excluded 533. Of the remaining 26 full-text articles, 8 were excluded with reasons, leaving 18 for detailed analyses. Meta-analysis was performed on 25 separate datasets (11 scalpel, 11 non-scalpel, 3 other/combined). Study follow-up ranged from 2 weeks to 37 years and sample sizes from 12 to 723 patients. The overall incidence of post-vasectomy pain was 15% (95% CI 9% to 25%). The incidences of post-vasectomy pain following scalpel and non-scalpel techniques were 24% (95% CI 15% to 36%) and 7% (95% CI 4% to 13%), respectively. Post-vasectomy pain syndrome occurred in 5% (95% CI 3% to 8%) of subjects, with similar estimates for both techniques. We conclude that the overall incidence of post-vasectomy pain is greater than previously reported, with three-fold higher rates of pain following traditional scalpel, compared to non-scalpel vasectomy, whereas the incidence of post-vasectomy pain syndrome is similar.",

    "document": "Role of Lactobacillus reuteri in Human Health and Diseases\nLactobacillus reuteri  ( L. reuteri ) is a well-studied probiotic bacterium that can colonize a large number of mammals. In humans,  L. reuteri  is found in different body sites, including the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, skin, and breast milk. The abundance of  L. reuteri  varies among different individuals. Several beneficial effects of  L. reuteri  have been noted. First,  L. reuteri  can produce antimicrobial molecules, such as organic acids, ethanol, and reuterin. Due to its antimicrobial activity,  L. reuteri  is able to inhibit the colonization of pathogenic microbes and remodel the commensal microbiota composition in the host. Second,  L. reuteri  can benefit the host immune system. For instance, some  L. reuteri  strains can reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines while promoting regulatory T cell development and function. Third, bearing the ability to strengthen the intestinal barrier, the colonization of  L. reuteri  may decrease the microbial translocation from the gut lumen to the tissues. Microbial translocation across the intestinal epithelium has been hypothesized as an initiator of inflammation. Therefore, inflammatory diseases, including those located in the gut as well as in remote tissues, may be ameliorated by increasing the colonization of  L. reuteri . Notably, the decrease in the abundance of  L. reuteri  in humans in the past decades is correlated with an increase in the incidences of inflammatory diseases over the same period of time. Direct supplementation or prebiotic modulation of  L. reuteri  may be an attractive preventive and/or therapeutic avenue against inflammatory diseases.",

Do your best to get more sleep, wash your hands constantly, and do your best with the stress (obviously easier said than done). You may want to consider a multivitamin if you are not getting fruits/vegetables, although that is not really going to do much."

    "document": "Prevalence of incidental prostate cancer: A systematic review of autopsy studies\nProstate cancer screening may detect nonprogressive cancers, leading to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The potential for overdiagnosis can be assessed from the reservoir of prostate cancer in autopsy studies that report incidental prostate cancer rates in men who died of other causes. We aimed to estimate the age-specific incidental cancer prevalence from all published autopsy studies. We identified eligible studies by searches of Medline and Embase, forward and backward citation searches and contacting authors. We screened the titles and abstracts of all articles; checked the full-text articles for eligibility and extracted clinical and pathology data using standardized forms. We extracted mean cancer prevalence, age-specific cancer prevalence and validity measures and then pooled data from all studies using logistic regression models with random effects. The 29 studies included in the review dated from 1948 to 2013. Incidental cancer was detected in all populations, with no obvious time trends in prevalence. Prostate cancer prevalence increased with each decade of age, OR\u2009=\u20091.7 (1.6\u20131.8), and was higher in studies that used the Gleason score, OR\u2009=\u20092.0 (1.1\u20133.7). No other factors were significantly predictive. The estimated mean cancer prevalence increased in a nonlinear fashion from 5% (95% CI: 3\u20138%) at age <30 years to 59% (95% CI: 48\u201371%) by age >79 years. There was substantial variation between populations in estimated cancer prevalence. There is a substantial reservoir of incidental prostate cancer which increases with age. The high risk of overdiagnosis limits the usefulness of prostate cancer screening. \n           \n             What\u2019s new? \n             Before symptoms of prostate cancer manifest clinically, many men die of other causes. Yet, prostate screening, particularly in older men, frequently turns out positive, resulting in overdiagnosis and overtreatment. This meta-analysis of published autopsy studies shows that incidental prostate cancer increases with age and with the use of sensitive screening strategies, especially in older men. Among men whose prostate cancers are designated \u201cfavorable-risk,\u201d active surveillance and subsequent biopsy can result in reclassification with higher-grade cancer, purely by chance. The potential for the detection of clinically irrelevant, incidental prostate cancer is high, indicating a need for improved screening strategies.",

We conducted a prospective feasibility study in postmenopausal women diagnosed with early-stage (0\u20133) hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer who were candidates for treatment with adjuvant AI therapy ( n  = 16). Tendons of the hands and wrists and the median nerve were imaged using gray-scale and power Doppler ultrasound (US) and US SWE. Arthralgia symptoms were evaluated using the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (BCPT) Symptom Checklist musculoskeletal subscale (MS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and stiffness subscales. At baseline, there were significant differences in the SW velocities of tendons between dominant and nondominant hands. Increased velocity in 2 of 6 tendons and the median nerve was associated with greater pain at baseline, whereas slower velocity of the extensor digitorum tendon (suggesting decreased stiffness) was associated with a higher WOMAC stiffness score. Increased SW velocity (suggestive of increased stiffness) at baseline in the abductor pollicis longus tendon was associated with a worsening of all three pain and stiffness measures by 6 months. Future studies should evaluate SWE scores related to AIA outcomes in a larger sample size.",

    "question": "17F - 5'6 - 245lbs - Adderall,Levothyroxine,Diclofenac Potassium - nonsmoking - Objective Tinnitus (clicking audible to me and other people) - happening for 3 years\n\n_________________\n\n[Here is are a few videos of the noise to give you a better understanding.](\n\nSo I'm 17, my ears have been clicking since I was 14. It started clicking when I got ear tubes because of I was getting tons of infections. That was when I was 14, and I got the tubes removed when I was 16 because I assumed it was the tubes that were causing the problems and if I got them taken out that it'd stop. Well, apparently not because even after getting them removed im still having the clicking. After seeing so many doctors I am EXTREMELY skeptical. Man, you should hear me before my appointments, every time I go I say to my mom, \"What if they don't know what's wrong\" and she always says, \"They will!\" I'm sure she feels different now after all these doctors coming up with nothing.\n\nEdit to add that I am unable to blow my nose because it causes pressure and pain. My ears constantly feel like how they feel when you go on an airplane, the only way to get relief is to hold my nose and suck in. I probably look crazy because I do it every few minutes.\n\nLately my mental health has gotten bad and the clicking has made it worse, to the point where I was hospitalized for selfharm/suicidal thoughts. I saw 4 normal ents, one Audiologist, one neurologist (who was the only one who took me seriously), and one ENT who specializes in ears. So far ive been told to go off my medicine for my depression and migraines so I did. I feel terrible, but its nice to prove them wrong because the noise is still happening like I told them it would. I had been off this medicine for over 3 months back in January (which is when I was hospitalized) and the clicking was still happening.\n\nMy doctor that I have now said that it might be my palatal muscle having a spasm. He said that because he \"saw my palate move when the clicking happened\". Well, I sat in front of a mirror for 10 minutes while the clicking was happening and it didn't move at all. He now wants to put in ear tubes because I have fluid in both ears. A month ago he said I definitely need tubes and we tried many times to call and schedule the surgery but no one answered or called us back after we left a message. We finally got ahold of him and now he seems unsure if he will put the tubes in. Im assuming that one of the reasons for that is because im looking for a new doctor. He also said he wanted to see me again to make sure I still have fluid in my ears which im 100% positive that I do, partly because i can feel it and partly because its literally leaking out of the ear with the hole in it. I want to get the tubes because he said that might be why my ears always feel like they are in an airplane but at the same time im scared because I think they are what caused the problem in the first place. But this doctor didn't even see that I had a hole in my eardrum. He went in there with the biggest magnifying glass ear looking thing but didn't even notice the hole in my eardrum?? \n\n Ive done alot of research into this and [I found this article]( that sounds extremely similar. Also a tensor tympani muscle spasm seems possible. I have been told many times that the ear tubes didn't cause this but then why did it start as soon as I got the tubes? \n\nI had been seeing one doctor who was convinced it was because of a hole in my eardrum (from the tubes that HE took out) and I was literally poked on my eardrum with acid two times. \n\nMy hearing sucks, [here is my hearing test results from a few weeks ago.]( I'm not sure if she wrote on there that when she put a thing that sucks to see the pressure that the line was really flat, I'm not sure if that means high pressure or low pressure. But on one of my ears a vacuum didn't even form. She said that means I've had an infection recently- which is news to me because my ears felt exactly the same as they did everyday, no pain or anything you normally feel with ear infections. My eardrums are very scarred, I had ear tubes as an infant, have always had ear infections, and got tubes again at 14 which I think caused this. \n\nWhen I saw my neurologist I literally broke down crying because he was the only one who saw how much this is affecting me, and he sent a recommendation to a Neurotologist. Im scheduled to see this doctor in a few months.\n\nI'm wondering if should I go ahead with getting the tubes or should I wait and see what the other doctor has to say?\n\n I'm going to assume that even if he thought I needed tubes that he probably wouldn't do it because he seems like too high of a doctor to just do ear tubes.",
    "document": "Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Otorrhea from a Persistent Tympanomeningeal Fissure Presenting as Recurrent Serous Otitis Media\nWe describe spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea through a patent tympanomeningeal (Hyrtl) fissure presenting as recurrent serous otitis media. The CSF leak was observed when a drain was placed through the tympanic membrane by an otologist. The diagnosis was then confirmed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, and the patient underwent a successful surgical treatment via a retrosigmoid approach. We describe the case and review causes of spontaneous CSF rhinorrhea/otorrhea.",
    "response": "This is all speculation on my part but I hope it helps.\n\nOne rare source of fluid behind the ear is cerebrospinal fluid, which is the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. An abnormal connection between this space and the middle ear can lead to chronic drainage of fluid in the absence of significant allergy symptoms. This can predispose to ear infections and can certainly lead to scarring of the ear drum, ear pain, high pressure inside the middle ear causing it to leak out of any available hole (perforation in ear drum --> otorrhea; or Eustachian tube --> nostril/throat) producing the squirting sounds.\n\nI think you're onto something with your article on the post-operative patient. However, that patient underwent a huge surgery; ear tube placement wouldn't cause that. Most commonly CSF otorrhea is due to head trauma but there are congenital causes that can lead to its development spontaneously at any age. It's possible that you developed a spontaneous CSF leak prompting ear tube placement, and when the tubes were placed they created the narrow opening needed for the fluid to noisily squirt out.\n\nIt could be worth testing the fluid for CSF markers to evaluate its origin. If positive, imaging can be done to identify the defect and explore surgical options. Discuss this possibility with the neurotologist. Tensor tympani syndrome does not explain the fluid behind the eardrum so it seems less likely to me.\n\nThese articles discuss spontaneous CSF otorrhea. They are targeted to medical professionals but you might still find them interesting. Best of luck!"

She was diagnosed at 19 and has been working hard to recover, she takes her medication very seriously and has attended DBT courses through her university. She also does yoga and practices mindfulness, which she claims help her a lot and I have seen a big difference in her since she was diagnosed and started looking after herself.\n\nHowever, for the past couple of months it seems like she\u2019s really gone downhill. She came home for the summer in May, I know she doesn\u2019t really like coming home because our house isn\u2019t very nice to live in at the moment, there\u2019s no work for her to take up over the summer months, and our financial situation isn\u2019t great. She\u2019s gone to visit her friends a lot and even went on holiday for 2 weeks, but it seems after a few days at home she\u2019s very drawn into herself and she gets quiet and temperamental.\n\nThe other night, we ran into each other in the kitchen and it was very obvious she\u2019d been crying. I asked her what was wrong and she said she was \u2018having a bad brain day\u2019. I asked her if something had happened and she said no, just that she\u2019d had a bit of a cry for no reason. I left it at that but I was worried about her.\n\nShe usually gets up at 8am every day and makes coffee whilst I\u2019m using the bathroom. This morning, it got to 11am and I realised she wasn\u2019t awake yet and honestly, I panicked. She has had a suicide attempt before and I jumped to conclusions because she was upset the night before, but she was just asleep in her bed. Later on, she complained that she\u2019d slept for about 12 hours but she was completely exhausted, as well as that her jaw was aching and clicking, likely from grinding her teeth.\n\nShe spent the rest of the day in her room as she was complaining of a headache, she came downstairs for dinner but was very quiet and went straight to bed after. I think I heard her crying in her room again but I wasn\u2019t sure and didn\u2019t want to disturb her.\n\nShe seemed a little better today but complained again of feeling exhausted and having problems with her jaw and a headache. She deteriorated this evening when she suddenly got quite a bad stomach ache, she barely age her dinner and promptly vomited what she had managed to eat. \n\nI should also note that over the past few months she\u2019s been convinced that she\u2019s losing her hair. I personally disagree, but she\u2019s become very self conscious over a bald patch that is apparently forming on the crown of her head. She doesn\u2019t think this is a side effect of her medication because it was an issue before she started taking it. She\u2019s also been randomly getting acne this summer, which she hasn\u2019t really had an issue with before. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this all seems a bit scattered but I\u2019m very concerned. My daughter is going back to university in a week and there isn\u2019t time for her to see a doctor in the area where we live, but her mental health is becoming a concern to me.",
    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

    "document": "Marginal vitamin C status is associated with reduced fat oxidation during submaximal exercise in young adults\nBackground \n             Vitamin C is a cofactor in the biosynthesis of carnitine, a molecule required for the oxidation of fatty acids. A reduction in the ability to oxidize fat may contribute to the reported inverse relationship between vitamin C status and adiposity. To examine this possibility, we conducted a preliminary trial to evaluate the impact of vitamin C status on fat oxidation during submaximal exercise. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Fat energy expenditure was determined in individuals with marginal (n = 15) or adequate (n = 7) vitamin C status during a submaximal, 60-minute treadmill test. Subsequently, eight of the subjects with marginal vitamin C status completed an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, depletion-repletion trial with submaximal exercise testing. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Individuals with marginal vitamin C status oxidized 25% less fat per kg body weight during the treadmill test as compared to individuals with adequate vitamin C status. Fat oxidation during exercise was inversely related to fatigue (r = -0.611, p = 0.009).

It is important to understand the implications of cannabis use during childhood and adolescence on brain development. This is the first longitudinal study that compared resting functional connectivity of frontally mediated networks between 43 healthy controls (HCs; 20 females; age  M  = 16.5 \u00b1 2.7) and 22 treatment-seeking adolescents with cannabis use disorder (CUD; 8 females; age  M  = 17.6 \u00b1 2.4). Increases in resting functional connectivity between caudal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and superior frontal gyrus across time were found in HC, but not in CUD. CUD showed a decrease in functional connectivity between caudal ACC and dorsolateral and orbitofrontal cortices across time. Lower functional connectivity between caudal ACC cortex and orbitofrontal cortex at baseline predicted higher amounts of cannabis use during the following 18 months. Finally, high amounts of cannabis use during the 18-month interval predicted lower intelligence quotient and slower cognitive function measured at follow-up. These data provide compelling longitudinal evidence suggesting that repeated exposure to cannabis during adolescence may have detrimental effects on brain resting functional connectivity, intelligence, and cognitive function.",

In the laboratory situation, deficits resulting from sleep deprivation are clearly and definitively demonstrable. Sleep loss in the clinical situation is usually sleep deprivation superimposed on chronic sleep loss. An examination of questionnaire studies, the literature on reports of sleep loss, studies of the reduction of work hours on performance as well as observational and a few interventional studies have yielded contradictory and often equivocal results. The residents generally find they feel better working fewer hours but improvements in patient care are often not reported or do not occur. A change in the attitude of the resident toward his role and his patient has not been salutary. Decreasing sleep loss should have had a positive effect on patient care in reducing medical error, but this remains to be unequivocally demonstrated.",

    "document": "Curse of the ghost pills: the role of oral controlled-release formulations in the passage of empty intact shells in faeces. Two case reports and a literature review relevant to psychiatry\nOrally taken tablets in different formulations continue to have a central role in the treatment of various psychiatric and medical conditions. In order to improve compliance, reduce the frequency of taking medications and minimize the peaks and troughs associated with certain immediate-release formulations, pharmaceutical companies have developed a number of novel methods of delivering oral solid dosage medications in the form of controlled-release (CR) formulations. Some CR formulations have been associated with pharmacobezoars and false-positive findings on certain physical investigations. Though CR drugs are commonly used in psychiatry, clinicians appear to have a limited understanding of how they are released for absorption once ingested. Some have insoluble parts that are excreted in faeces as \u2018ghost pills\u2019. Due to lack of awareness of this phenomenon to both patients and the physicians, anxiety has ensued in some patients. Some clinicians have been puzzled or have been dismissive when faced with curious patients wanting to know more after they had observed tablet-like looking structures in faeces. We present two cases from our clinical setting and a few drawn from the World Wide Web to highlight the role of CR medications and their association with the ghost pill phenomenon. The mechanisms involved in drug release relevant to psychiatry medications are also briefly reviewed. The ghost pill phenomenon occurs with certain CR medications. This is a normal and expected outcome related to drug-release mechanisms of some of these products. It is inevitable that some patients will see what looks like tablets or capsules in faeces. Raising awareness of this phenomenon among clinicians would facilitate discussions and information sharing at the initial process of medication prescribing. Awareness among patients and carers would also help to allay anxiety.",
    "response": "I am a speech therapist that works with swallowing problems so I did a course last year on medications and pills. The course talked a lot about crushing pills and why it was dangerous by talking about how pills are constructed. \n\nOne of the ways pills are made, particularly for extended release, is to have a matrix of a carrier material and the medicine is dispersed throughout the carrier material.  It takes time for all the sections of the medicine to be released, spreading out the dose.  But the side effect is that you excrete the carrier material looking pretty like the original pill.\n\nYou could ask a pharmacist but I would take bets on this being your answer."

    "question": "I know there are a few neurologists that frequent r/askdocs so I thought this would be a shot. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just have a few questions.\n\n**Back story**\n\nMy brother, 46 athletic male, was in a rollover ATV/4Wheeler accident 15 days ago. He was riding down a country road adjacent to his ranch and rolled with a 650-pound ATV causing both cranial/facial crushing and accelerate/decelerate brain injuries. He was helicoptered to a Level 1 Trauma Hospital specializing in Brain and Spine injuries. While he raced competitive motocross for most of his life, he was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident as he was 2 minutes from his ranch tending to a stuck vehicle. He was breathing on his own at the time of the accident but has not been conscious or significantly responsive since the accident. It happened in front of his wife so she was able to tend to him immediately and call for help. He was breathing but hypoxic injuries were a concern.\n\nWithin 24 hours he was placed into a medically induced (pentobarbital) coma and given a GCS of 3. CT Scans showed 17 cranial fractures along with a brain hemorrhage on the left side. Hypoxic injuries and Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) were the two other things we were not able to confirm but were on the list of concerns of possible injury to the frontal cortex. We knew we would be able to discover these based on an MRI if we could get him stable enough to complete an MRI. After 5 days, coma medication was weened off but Intra-cranial pressure began to spike (ICP as high as 48 for a few minutes) so he was placed back on the pentobarbital for 2 more days. On day 7 of the medically induced coma, he was weened once again off the medication and evaluated every 12 hours. He\u2019s been unresponsive to name calls and noxious pressure to the sternum other than some arm and leg twitches and recently eye fluttering (not opening but eye lid movement). Eyes are fixed and do not respond to light. He coughs, involuntarily, based on ventilator tube changes and suction. His lower body is abnormally postured with stiff legs and pointed toes. Hands are tight, but not so much clinched (based on the research on Decerebrate Posturing). His head is not tilted back. We\u2019ve been here for 5 days now and he was stable enough to get an MRI as his ICP levels have been between 9 and 20. He's currently at a GCS of 4 and has been off everything for nearly a week other than Oxycodine for pain. This sounds crazy but to get a good exam and response, his team wanted him off as much as possible to get an accurate assessment of cognition.\n\n**Here are the impression notes from the CT Scan:**\n\nThe right frontal approach ventriculostomy catheter now terminates left of midline, at the junction of the left lateral ventricle/ foramen of Monroe. A small amount of intraventicular hemorrhage on the right has increased since the prior study, likely related to the catheter placement.\n\nThere is no hydrocephalus or midline shift.\n\nThe intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia, and adjacent vasogenic edema, are unchanged.\n\nA small chronic infarct of the left caudate nucleus is redemonstrated.\n\nThe small amount of intraventricular hemorrhage, in the posterior portions of the lateral ventricles, has diminished in quantity.\n\n**Here are the impression notes from the MRI:**\n\nPersistent right parietal ventriculostomy catheter, with tip adjacent to septum pellucideum. Persistent nonspecific edema and hemorrhagic blood products surrounding the catherter tract.\n\nPersistent focal hemorrhage and edema in the left inferior basal ganglia.\n\nFew additional tiny regions of the susceptibility artifact are also noted in the high right cerebral convexity, and the medial right thalamus.\n\nAdditional tiny intra-ventricular hemorrhages in the occipital horns and both lateral ventricles.\n\nI\u2019ve posted his MRI here [ (the first few seconds are still and he does have a PICC line)\n\n**My questions**\n\nBased on what we\u2019ve been told, he\u2019s been diagnosed with Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI) Grade 3 in both the frontal cortex, occipital horns, and the brain stem. They\u2019re not seeing anything that would indicate hypoxic injuries but with a DAI Grade 3, it\u2019s pretty much worst case scenario with or without Hypoxic injury. With that said, does the MRI correspond with these injuries? Based on other imaging I've looked at of DAI Grade 3, I'm not seeing as much \"black dots\" of injury but that could be from swelling. Is there anything else that I should ask about my brother\u2019s condition as we try to figure out what\u2019s best for him and his family?\n\nThank you for reading and God bless.\n\n**EDIT:** I just want to give a quick update. After reviewing many of the things that you all gave us guidance on and consulting with his medical team, we made the family decision to seek hospice care. We were concerned that he was breathing over the ventilator so we were unsure of what the next few days would hold and he moved on to the next world just a few minutes later. His body was just unable to recover. He went peacefully without issue.\n\nI want thank you all for your kindness, guidance and support during this post. The world is still a bright and loving place and from my family to yours, I wish you nothing but health, safety and happiness in your future.  \n\n\nI am leaving this post up to hopefully give someone in the future some answers that may help them on their journey.  \n\n\nHere's an image of my brother if you wish to put a face to the story.

    "document": "Time to Recover Consciousness in Patients with Diffuse Axonal Injury : Assessment with Reference to Magnetic Resonance Grading\nObjective \n             This study was conducted to investigate the correlation between the degrees of injury on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the time interval to recovery of consciousness in patients with diffuse axonal injury. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             From January 2004 to December 2008, 25 patients with diffuse axonal injury were treated at our hospital. We retrospectively investigated the patients' medical records and radiological findings. We divided the patients into three groups according to the grade of MRI finding : grade I, small scattered lesions on the white matter of the cerebral hemisphere; grade II, focal lesions on the corpus callosum; and grade III, additional focal lesions on the brain stem. \n           \n           \n             Result \n             Seven patients belonged to the grade I group; 10 to the grade II group; and 8 to the grade III group. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of all patients at the time of admission was 7.28. Recovery of consciousness was observed in 23 of the 25 patients; the remaining two patients never regained consciousness. The time interval to recovery of consciousness (awake status) ranged from 1 day to 125 days (mean 22.1 days) : grade I group patients, within approximately 1 week (mean 3.7 days); grade II group patients, within approximately 2 weeks (mean 12.5 days); and grade III group patients, within approximately 2 months (mean 59.5 days). \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Our study results suggest a correlation between the mean time interval to recovery of consciousness in patients with diffuse axonal injuries and the degrees of brain injuries seen on MRI. Patients with grade I and II diffuse axonal injuries recovered consciousness within 2 weeks, while patients with grade III injuries required approximately 2 months.",

Based on other imaging I've looked at of DAI Grade 3, I'm not seeing as much \"black dots\" of injury but that could be from swelling.\n\nHard to say. They don't mention lesions in the brain stem in the report. The most relevant MR sequences starts at 03:52 in the video, but has a weird windowing: it looks 'overexposed'. You can correct that in radiology software. Where certainly is a lesion in the left side of the brain stem, but I haven't seen the microbleeding there.\n\nDAI doesn't predict particularly well how somebody recovers, unfortunately. The fixed pupils are very concerning. I would order labs to measure the barbiturate level to make sure that doesn't explain his current condition."

Recent reports indicate an increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents around the world in all ethnicities, even if the prevalence of obesity is not increasing any more. The majority of young people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus was found in specific ethnic subgroups such as African-American, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islanders and American Indians. Clinicians should be aware of the frequent mild or asymptomatic manifestation of type 2 diabetes mellitus in childhood. Therefore, a screening seems meaningful especially in high risk groups such as children and adolescents with obesity, relatives with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and clinical features of insulin resistance (hypertension, dyslipidemia, polycystic ovarian syndrome, or acanthosis nigricans). Treatment of choice is lifestyle intervention followed by pharmacological treatment ( e.g ., metformin). New drugs such as dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors or glucagon like peptide 1 mimetics are in the pipeline for treatment of youth with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, recent reports indicate a high dropout of the medical care system of adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus suggesting that management of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus requires some remodeling of current healthcare practices.",

This rare parasomnia is poorly recognized by general practitioners and by urologists and sexologists. \n           \n           \n             Aim \n             To gain more insight into diagnostics and therapeutic options. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Data from a series of 24 consecutive patients who presented with SRPEs at the outpatient clinic from 1996 to 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Additional questionnaires were completed to complement data and to obtain information about follow-up. Long-term treatment efficacy of baclofen was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. \n           \n           \n             Outcomes \n             SRPEs were not associated with urologic, surgical, or psychiatric history or with serum testosterone levels. The mean doctors\u2019 delay was 3.5 years. 14 of the 24 patients were treated with baclofen (10\u201375 mg). In 11 of them, complete remission was observed within a few weeks. 2 of the 3 remaining patients noticed a slight improvement of SPRE symptoms and only 1 patient experienced no effect at all. After an average follow-up of 4.5 years, only 41.6% of patients who had used baclofen were satisfied with their SRPEs. The others (58.4%) were dissatisfied, mostly owing to relapse of symptoms after the discontinuation of baclofen. Other treatment forms were applied sporadically, with strongly varying results. \n           \n           \n             Clinical Implications \n             This overview of SRPE contributes to a better clinical understanding and recognition of the phenomenon and provides new, more constructed advice about therapeutic implications, especially concerning the use of baclofen. \n           \n           \n             Strengths and Limitations \n             This study provides a systematic overview of a relatively large series of patients with SRPE, which provides substantiated treatment advice. However, treatment efficacy was based mainly on the patients\u2019 subjective perception and it was not possible to compare the results of baclofen with other forms of pharmacologic treatment, because these alternative drugs were applied only sporadically. Nevertheless, this study is directional for future research. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             This study confirmed a long doctors\u2019 delay in patients with SRPE.

In the beginning of this month, I started having numbness/tingling in my hands and feet and face and a constant pressure in my chest. The pressure was 24/7, my heart was always racing, had very bad shortness of breath, and my blood pressure was high. I went to the ER for it twice, then ended up being admitted for observation for three days. During this time, I felt consistently disoriented and nauseous as well as the chest pain. They did blood work every day including troponins and d-dimer, ekgs, an echo, chest/back X-ray, ct with contrast, and an endoscopy. They found nothing. After 3 days they sent me home. \n\nAt home, I started feeling marginally better and even had one day where I had no chest pain or nausea at all.  Made a Dr appointment and started having pain in the middle of my back (which is still there and hasn\u2019t gone away at all). I went to the cardiologist and told him about everything (I was having chest pain at the time of the visit) and he chalked it up to stress (because I\u2019m young of course) and put me on a 5 day holter monitor. Then I noticed I started waking from my sleep with a pounding/racing heart and could not go back to sleep. These episodes have only increased in the past two days, with last night having me awake until 3am with a racing heart, pinching and burning in the chest area, incredible nausea, and numbness in my left hand. I was afraid I\u2019d die if I fell asleep. I took Tums for the burning thinking it might be heartburn but it didn\u2019t help. \n\nThis morning, my chest is heavy and still burning and I\u2019m coughing, and my pulse at rest is 80-90bpm. If I just get up to walk it shoots up to the 120\u2019s and 130\u2019s. My throat feels tight and I still have the nausea. My chest wall between my boobs feels sore when I touch it. I tried to hold a conversation over breakfast with my husband and couldn\u2019t without losing my breath. I don\u2019t know why I would start feeling better and then feel worse again? I debated going back to the ER last night but felt stupid considering I\u2019ve been there twice already and they didn\u2019t find anything when I was there for 3 days. \n\nI got both shots of Pfizer and this all started right after. One doctor at the hospital thought it could be lingering inflammation from the shot, but I still don\u2019t understand why I would start feeling better then get substantially worse again. At this point I\u2019m constantly worrying I\u2019m about to die but at the same time thinking I\u2019m a hypochondriac. I told the cardiologist I\u2019ve had anxiety/panic attacks before and I know what that feels like, and I\u2019ve never felt this awful in my life. I haven\u2019t been hyperventilating. He brushed me off. I still have the holter monitor on until Tuesday. \n\nIs it possible something new happened in the time since I went to the hospital? (Discharged May 18).

    "document": "Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in patients of novel coronavirus disease 2019\nAbstract \n           \n             Background \n             The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not been fully demonstrated. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             A total of 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (n=535) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress was analyzed. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was 93.1%, 82.7% and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-11, day-12 and day-14, separately. The presence of antibodies was <40% among patients within 1-week since onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM) and 79.8% (IgG) since day-15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day-7 to 45.5% (25/55) during day 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (p<0.001), even in early phase of 1-week since onset (p=0.007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (p=0.006). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.",
    "response": "If you had tested positive for COVID-19 two weeks ago, it is indeed possible that you are still positive, even if you have recovered clinically. Some patients continue to shed virus for longer periods of time (I think the maximum has been upto 49 days). However, most people will not be shedding active virus in 4 weeks after being positive (3 weeks should be enough, I am being conservative). The immunity from the infection is probably quite long-lasting (at least until this pandemic is over), so you don't need to worry until a mutated strain starts circulating in a few years. One can get external clothing contaminated by secretions from people with active infection, so you can theoretically transport virus on your clothes, but I think that probability is low, unless you are a health care provider in a COVID-19 unit. Regardless, I would suggest you shower and change clothes before meeting your dad, which you can do in a couple of weeks."

    "document": "Temporal profiles of viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples and serum antibody responses during infection by SARS-CoV-2: an observational cohort study\nBackground \n             Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe community and nosocomial outbreaks. Comprehensive data for serial respiratory viral load and serum antibody responses from patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are not yet available. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are usually obtained for serial viral load monitoring of respiratory infections but gathering these specimens can cause discomfort for patients and put health-care workers at risk. We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We did a cohort study at two hospitals in Hong Kong. We included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. We obtained samples of blood, urine, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, and rectal swabs. Serial viral load was ascertained by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 internal nucleoprotein (NP) and surface spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) were measured using EIA. Whole-genome sequencing was done to identify possible mutations arising during infection. \n           \n           \n             Findings \n             Between Jan 22, 2020, and Feb 12, 2020, 30 patients were screened for inclusion, of whom 23 were included (median age 62 years [range 37\u201375]). The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5\u00b72 log 10  copies per mL (IQR 4\u00b71\u20137\u00b70). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope \u22120\u00b715, 95% CI \u22120\u00b719 to \u22120\u00b711;  R 2 =0\u00b771). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's \u03c1=0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b7074\u20130\u00b775; p=0\u00b7020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15). Anti-SARS-CoV-2-NP or anti-SARS-CoV-2-RBD IgG levels correlated with virus neutralisation titre ( R 2 >0\u00b79). No genome mutations were detected on serial samples. \n           \n           \n             Interpretation \n             Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers. Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic. This finding emphasises the importance of stringent infection control and early use of potent antiviral agents, alone or in combination, for high-risk individuals. Serological assay can complement RT-qPCR for diagnosis. \n           \n           \n             Funding \n             Richard and Carol Yu, May Tam Mak Mei Yin, The Shaw Foundation Hong Kong, Michael Tong, Marina Lee, Government Consultancy Service, and Sanming Project of Medicine.",

    "document": "A Systematic Review of Topical Finasteride in the Treatment of Androgenetic Alopecia in Men and Women\nINTRODUCTION: \n             Currently, only topical minoxidil (MNX) and oral finasteride (FNS) are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia. Although FNS is efficacious for hair regrowth, its systemic use is associated with side effects limiting long-term utilization. Exploring topical FNS as an alternative treatment regimen may prove promising. \n           \n           \n             METHODS: \n             A search was conducted to identify studies regarding human  in vivo  topical FNS treatment efficacy including clinically relevant case reports, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective studies. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS: \n             Seven articles were included in this systematic review. In all studies, there was significant decrease in the rate of hair loss, increase in total and terminal hair counts, and positive hair growth assessment with topical FNS. Both scalp and plasma DHT significantly decreased with application of topical FNS, however no changes in serum testosterone were noted. \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSION: \n             Preliminary results on the use of topical FNS are limited but safe and promising. Continued research into drug-delivery, ideal topical concentration and application frequency, side effects and use for other alopecias will help to elucidate the full extent of topical FNS\u2019 use.",

    "document": "Adverse Effects and Safety of 5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors (Finasteride, Dutasteride): A Systematic Review\nFinasteride and dutasteride, both 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, are considered first-line treatment for androgenetic hair loss in men and used increasingly in women. In each case, patients are expected to take the medications indefinitely despite the lack of research regarding long-term adverse effects. Concerns regarding the adverse effects of these medications has led the United States National Institutes of Health to add a link for post-finasteride syndrome to its Genetic and Rare Disease Information Center. Herein, the authors report the results of a literature search reviewing adverse events of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors as they relate to prostate cancer, psychological effects, sexual health, and use in women. Several large studies found no increase in incidence of prostate cancer, a possible increase of high-grade cancer when detected, and no change in survival rate with 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use. Currently, there is no direct link between 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use and depression; however, several small studies have led to depression being listed as a side effect on the medication packaging. Sexual effects including erectile dysfunction and decreased libido and ejaculate were reported in as many as 3.4 to 15.8 percent of men. To date, there are very few studies evaluating 5-alpha reductase inhibitor use in women. Risks include birth defects in male fetuses if used in pregnancy, decreased libido, headache, gastrointestinal discomfort, and isolated reports of changes in menstruation, acne, and dizziness. Overall, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors were well-tolerated in both men and women, but not without risk, highlighting the importance of patient education prior to treatment.",

    "document": "Role of cannabis in cardiovascular disorders\nThe growing popularity of medical and recreational consumption of cannabis, especially among the youth, raises immediate concerns regarding its safety and long-terms effects. The cardiovascular effects of cannabis are not well known. Cannabis consumption has been shown to cause arrhythmia including ventricular tachycardia, and potentially sudden death, and to increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). These effects appear to be compounded by cigarette smoking and precipitated by excessive physical activity, especially during the first few hours of consumption. Cannabinoids, or the active compounds of cannabis, have been shown to have heterogeneous effects on central and peripheral circulation. Acute cannabis consumption has been shown to cause an increase in blood pressure, specifically systolic blood pressure (SBP), and orthostatic hypotension. Cannabis use has been reported to increase risk of ischemic stroke, particularly in the healthy young patients. The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is currently considered as a promising therapeutic target in the management of several disease conditions. Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are being increasingly investigated for their therapeutic effects; however, the value of their benefits over possible complications remains controversial. Despite the considerable research in this field, the benefits of cannabis and its synthetic derivatives remains questionable even in the face of an increasingly tolerating attitude towards recreational consumption and promotion of the therapeutic complications. More efforts are needed to increase awareness among the public, especially youth, about the cardiovascular risks associated with cannabis use and to disseminate the accumulated knowledge regarding its ill effects.",

Will completely disappear from one area and pop up somewhere else. \nThe cycle of the disappearing and reappearing has been ongoing for three weeks, increasing in severity the past two days.\nNot warm to the touch, slightly itchy slightly tingly. \n\nThe rash is not on the face, bottom of the feet, or hands. \n\nThe rash is mainly on the legs, but also the side, arms, back, and ear. \n\nThe left ankle is now very swollen and painful and the rash has moved 4\" down the foot overnight. The same happened with the right wrist but the rash is moving up the arm not down the hand. \n\nThe doctors think there's a small chance it might be Lyme but Costa Rica and the US in Washington State (Seattle) our home are not known for Lyme. \n\nIf it's relevant, a week after it started she got a bad cold/flu, duration of one week (cleared 1.5 weeks ago), but that has completely resolved.\n\nAlso she works professionally with exotic animals, including primates (including macaques), invertebrates, elephants, and hoofstock. She has never been bitten by anything or been diagnosed with any zoonotic illnesses. It's been almost two months since she last worked with macaques, and she never had any herpes b exposure. \n\nWe were at the Arenal area in Costa Rica and Samara. No bite or sting or tick was identified when the rash appeared. \n\nAny help is appreciated!!\n\nPictures:\n \nProgression:",

    "question": "Age: 17\n\nSex: FtM (\"F\" if I must..)\n\nWeight: ~145\n\nHeight: 5' 6\"\n\nRace: White\n\nI made a throwaway account specificallly for this. I debated posting this for months because people suck. I'm hoping that as this is a subreddit to ask \"medical professionals\", then the comments will be professional. \n\n\nAs title says, I've been taking testosterone injections for almost 2 years now on May 23rd. Currently taking .25 weekly shots (IM) and have been doing that since December 2019. I'm also taking 3 .5 mg of norethindrone every day (so .15 daily). I've also been on 2 other birth control type medications. Norethindrone has been the only one to work, but only to an extent.\n\nBEFORE SOMEONE READS HALF WAY AND SAYS I SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR: I have and will mention it in the post.\n\n\nI've had problems with this since before testosterone, but that's too much to go into. But here's the several issues:\n\n1. First of all, still having it after multiple years on testosterone and norethindrone. \n\n2. It's extremely screwed up. It is not monthly. It is whenever tf it wants to be. Mulitple times a week or daily. 90% of the time it's *just* cramps. When there's blood, it's extremely light and light pink in color. \n\n3. The cramps are extremely painful, like my shit body is making up for the no blood part. They come in waves. I feel it start to build up, and then it feels like my organs are being skinned with a potato peeler. In most waves I get nauseous, a tight feeling in my chest, and I feel my heart race. Occasionally I get black spots in my vision and it's hard to breathe for a few seconds. I end up being incapacitated and doubled over for about 20-30 seconds in these waves until it passes and comes back in 2-3 minutes. I used to take aleve for the pain. It doesn't help anymore. Heat pads dont work either.\n\n4. What's incredibly weird to me is that it's triggered by physical activity. Not just working out/going for a run, but simply walking around a park for an hour or moving boxes around (recently moved) for a few minutes will set it off, and that's it for the night. That's all I can do and I have cramps pretty much on and off for the rest of the day. \n\nI have high cholesterol, high enough to be on meds for it at 17. I also enjoy working out. Working out would obviously be beneficial, but I cant do it. I actually do a full work out, and I have the cramps for the next few days and sometimes blood following it. \n\nMy doctor (endo) knows about this. Like I said, I've tried 2 other meds similar to norethindrone. Despite it sounding like norethindrone isn't helping it all, it is. When I went off to try another med, I had heavy bleeding and cramps nonstop every day. When other meds didn't work, he ordered an ultrasound. Ultrasound came back with nothing wrong. I have bloodwork done to monitor T levels every 7-8 months. T levels are in the \"perfect\" zone. At my last appointment I mentioned all of this. All he did was order another ultrasound for in 7 months before my next appointment. I don't think he understands the severity of this.\n\nMy mom asked another person, a nurse who specifically deals with trans male patients. He said he would recommend the same thing I'm doing: 3 .5 mg norethindrone a day. \n\nI'm losing my mind at this point. I can't work out in public because the cramps will start. Even then, I can't work out in general because I'll have severe waves of pain for the next few days. Even without physical activity, I still get it every few days. I have to wear pads every single day because I never know when I'll bleed. (If you don't know much about trans people, I will tell you this fucks with my mental health on a daily basis. The whole issue does). \n\nThe ultrasounds show nothing. I have no idea what this would be if it's period related, because even without blood the cramps still feel like it. \n\nI don't even know what I'm asking for. I guess just any suggestions on what this is. Yes both the testosterone and norethindrone work to some extent. (had to go off testosterone for 4 weeks for top surgery, had my first \"real\" period- blood, chunks, cramps and all that since starting treatment. had full bleeding (not just light pink stuff) when trying to switch off norethindrone). And yes I have had the other effects of testosterone. Deep voice, facial hair, etc. \n\nOther medications I'm on are the cholesterol meds (atorvastatin) (and only as of a few weeks ago) and prozac if that matters at all. \n\nI can't live my life with this and there's no apparent causes/reasons why I'm having this problem. Is there any chance that this isn't entirely period related? What else could this be- I have no other symptoms of anything else. Are there other medications/tests I should request? Please just give me something I'm desperate. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, just advice/suggestions.",
    "document": "Recurrence of endometriosis after hysterectomy\nAim:  Persistent or recurrent pain after hysterectomy is one of the most frustrating clinical scenarios in benign gynaecology. We attempt to review the current evidence regarding the recurrence of pelvic pain after hysterectomy for endometriosis. The impact of ovarian conservation, type of hysterectomy and the extent of surgical excision were analysed. \n           Methods:  Peer reviewed published manuscripts in the English language in the period between 1980 and 2014 were reviewed using Pubmed and science direct regarding the incidence, causes and recurrence of endometriosis. \n           Results:  Sixty-seven articles were identified. Incomplete excision of endometriosis is the most predominant reason in the literature for the recurrence of endometriosis, and the type of Hysterectomy affects the recurrent symptoms mainly by impacting the extent of excision of the lesion. Ovarian cyst drainage is associated with the highest rate of ovarian cyst reformation within three to six months after surgery. The use of hormone replacement therapy is associated with recurrence of pelvic pain in 3.5% of cases. No studies addressed the recurrence of endometriosis after standard vs robotic assisted hysterectomy. \n           Conclusion:  A high recurrence rate of 62% is reported in advanced stages of endometriosis in which the ovaries were conserved. Ovarian conservation carries a 6 fold risk of recurrent pain and 8 folds risk of reoperation. The decision has to be weighed taking into consideration the patient\u2019s age and the impact of early menopause on her life style. The recurrence of endometriosis symptoms and pelvic pain are directly correlated to the surgical precision and removal of peritoneal and deeply infiltrated disease. Surgical effort should always aim to eradicate the endometriotic lesions completely to keep the risk of recurrence as low as possible.",
    "response": "I'm sorry you're going through all of this. You stated you're seeing an endocrinologist. Have you seen an OBGYN? As you're a biological female with an intact uterus and ovaries, the differential would certainly include PCOS and endometriosis (PCOS doesn't always present with cysts on the ovaries). Being FTM, even on testosterone, won't eliminate either of the above without a hysterectomy (even then not definitive as elaborated below).\n\nIf I were you, I'd start from scratch at the OBGYN. If you've seen an OBGYN and they blew you off, try a different one. Good luck!"

    "question": "Age: 30\n\nSex: F (post hysterectomy. I am not contaminating the urine w/ menstrual blood)\n\nHeight: 173 cm\n\nWeight: 60 kg. I lost almost 28 kg in 6 months this year unintentionally but have gained back 10. \n\nRace: Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jewish.\n\nDuration of complaint: 1 year (hematuria for 6 mos)\n\nLocation: whole body\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues: confirmed cEDS via genetic testing, Raynauds, confirmed Nutcracker Syndrome (not phenomenon) awful gastro issues that have no name.\n\nCurrent medications: Oxycontin 10mg x2, XR Propranolol 160mg (migraines and BP) Ibuprofen/Paracetamol as needed\n\n-----------\nI reach out to the experts of Reddit as a last shot at figuring this out. \n\nFirstly, I know nutcracker should be the obvious answer for my hematuria but I have been to a vascular surgeon who said the amount of blood in my urine cannot be explained by the level of compression I have and cannot account for other symptoms. \n\nIn May I was in hospital for 2 weeks due to gastro issues. It was awful and I wasn't able to eat for much of that time. Thankfully with the more weight I gained back I was able to eat more comfortably and Oxycontin and Propranolol have the added bonus of curing my 40x a day toilet trips. I left without much of an answer but with a shiny new Nutcracker diagnosis (and narrowed mesenteric angle) for my troubles that they found on a CTA after my hematuria began while I was there. They also discovered a cherry tomato sized hard immovable lump in my abdomen but called it a calcified hernia (it wasn't as we later ruled out.)\n\nSince the hospital I have had daily macrohematuria. My pee ranges from pinky rose tinted to a deep brownish red and is frothy and bubbly. I have always had a lot of pee in my life and I thought it was just some quirk. However since the hematuria has led to multiple 24h collections I have since learned it is not okay to pee 6l a day when you only drink 3 liters of liquids. An average urination results in 300-900 mL of urine. \n\nMy daily symptoms (excluding joint and EDS symptoms): crushing exhaustion, general feeling of not being well, profuse sweating, occasional flank pain, lots of pelvic pain when I push on my abdomen or during sex, my abdominal lump has grown and I also have a new one in my neck, itchy as a mother.... (Unrelated to opiates),  standing makes me dizzy, my stomach bloats out constantly and it's hard and very painful, I feel really weak and like I can't do simple exercises (which is very important to me.)\n\nI am a pretty healthy person in spite of my EDS complications. I smoke marijuana occasionally and drink even less occasionally. I do not smoke. I eat mostly vegetarian but make sure to get my protein even though it feels pointless. I gained much of my life back when I began taking the low dose of oxycontin earlier this year and was able to make big gains with my PT for joint instability but these unrelated symptoms still persist. \n\nI may have forgotten things because my brain is awful right now but to the best of my knowledge this is everything. \n\n\nMy recent Labs (more on request) \n\n**BLOOD**\n\nGlucose: 82 normal\n\nUrea: 32 normal\n\nCreatinine: .66 normal\n\neGFR: 90 normal\n\nPotassium: 4.1 normal\n\nSodium: 136 normal\n\n\u2022 ** **Calcium:  10.6 HIGH**\n\n\u2022 ** **Protein total: 5.7 LOW** I cannot get this to increase no matter what I eat/do\n\n\u2022 ** **Albumin: 3.5 a little LOW**\n\nBilirubin total: .8 normal\n\nALKP: 65 normal\n\nALT: 26 normal\n\nAST: normal\n\nOsmolality: 281 normal\n\n\u2022 ** **Phosphorus 4.5 slightly elevated**\n\nVitamin D 1.25 (OH) 26\n\nPTH: 10 normal\n\nCRP: normal\n\nDNA ds Ab: normal\n\nCANCA & PANCA: normal\n\nC3: 123.3 normal\n\nC4: 26.8 normal\n\nHba1c: 5.1 normal\n\nUrea: 24 normal\n\nGGT: 11 normal\n\nTransferrin: 301 normal\n\nFerritin: 43 normal\n\nFolic acid: 5 normal\n\nWBC: 5.7 (typically it's around 3 or 4.

    "document": "Enhanced S-Cone Syndrome\nPurpose \n             To describe the detailed phenotype, long-term clinical course, clinical variability, and genotype of patients with enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS). \n           \n           \n             Design \n             Retrospective case series. \n           \n           \n             Participants \n             Fifty-six patients with ESCS. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Clinical history, examination, imaging, and electrophysiologic findings of 56 patients (age range, 1\u201375 years) diagnosed with ESCS were reviewed. Diagnosis was established by molecular confirmation of disease-causing variants in the  NR2E3  gene (n\u00a0= 38) or by diagnostic full-field electroretinography findings (n\u00a0=\u00a018). \n           \n           \n             Main Outcome Measures \n             Age at onset of visual symptoms, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), quantitative age-related electrophysiologic decline, and imaging findings. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Mean age at onset of visual symptoms was 4.0 years, and median age at presentation was 20.5\u00a0years, with mean follow-up interval being 6.1 years. Six patients were assessed once. Disease-causing variants in  NR2E3  were identified in 38 patients. Mean BCVA of the better-seeing eye was 0.32 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) at baseline and 0.39 logMAR at follow-up. In most eyes (76% [76/100]), BCVA remained stable, with a mean BCVA change of 0.07 logMAR during follow-up. Nyctalopia was the most common initial symptom, reported in 92.9% of patients (52/56). Clinical findings were highly variable and included foveomacular schisis (41.1% [26/56]), yellow-white dots (57.1% [32/56]), nummular pigmentation (85.7% [48/56]), torpedo-like lesions (10.7% [6/56]), and circumferential subretinal fibrosis (7.1% [4/56]). Macular and peripheral patterns of autofluorescence were classified as (1) minimal change, (2) hypoautofluorescent (mild diffuse, moderate speckled, moderate diffuse, or advanced), or (3) hyperautofluorescent flecks. One patient showed undetectable electroretinography findings; quantification of main electroretinography components in all other patients revealed amplitude and peak time variability but with pathognomonic electroretinography features. The main electroretinography components showed evidence of age-related worsening over 6.7 decades, at a rate indistinguishable from that seen in unaffected control participants. Eighteen sequence variants in  NR2E3  were identified, including 4 novel missense changes. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Enhanced S-cone syndrome has a highly variable phenotype with relative clinical and imaging stability over time. Most electroretinography findings have pathognomonic features, but quantitative assessment reveals variability and a normal mean rate of age-related decline, consistent with largely nonprogressive peripheral retinal dysfunction.",

    "question": "Hello. My father passed away a month ago and the police just called me to inform that they determined the cause of death to be suicide. \nThey claim that he offed himself through an overdose of an antidepressant called Sertraline in the amount of: 2.9\u03bcg/g. How many pills would that be if each one contains a 100 mg? Since I was there with him the night before he passed away, and i found the body, how long does it take to pass away when you overdose on antidepressants? I find the whole thing strange since he is a diabetic, and it just seems strange that he would commit suicide through antidepressants and not insulin which he has talked about before, forgive the strange question. He was very sick and couldn't even walk his last days basically, so i find it weird that I didn't find any Sertraline packets anywhere in the appartement. I am very troubled by all this and if anyone could please bring some clarity to mu questions it would be deeply appreciated.\n\nWhen i was there the night before, he had cramps, was nausious, looked pale and was sweating and his leg hurt. This was around 8 Pm. I found the body at 1. PM. The next day. He had been  sick a couple of days before and agreed that he would go with me to the hospital the following day. Is it likely that he had already overdosed when i was there with him? I would say that he probably died about 5 AM judging by his body. He must have taken the pills after I had left, right?\n\nSome more info about him:\n60 year old male.\n65 kgs.\nDiabetic.\nHad a heart attack a year ago which caused brain damage.\nBypass operation which caused a thrombus according to the medical exam after his death, which explains why he could barely walk his last days.\n\nThe results from the autopsy found:\n\nHe had no alcohol for a couple of months before his death and non at the time of death.

    "document": "Post-mortem clinical pharmacology\nClinical pharmacology assumes that deductions can be made about the concentrations of drugs from a knowledge of the pharmacokinetic parameters in an individual; and that the effects are related to the measured concentration. Post-mortem changes render the assumptions of clinical pharmacology largely invalid, and make the interpretation of concentrations measured in post-mortem samples difficult or impossible. Qualitative tests can show the presence of substances that were not present in life, and can fail to detect substances that led to death.

Consequently, compilations of \u2018lethal concentrations\u2019 are misleading. There is a lack of adequate studies of the true relationship between fatal events and the concentrations that can be measured subsequently, but without such studies, clinical pharmacologists and others should be wary of interpreting post-mortem measurements.",
    "response": "Alright, here I go.\n\nYour father was 65 kg. Dose of sertraline found in body was 2.9 micrograms per gram of body weight. This comes down to 188.5 milligrams of absorbed sertraline. This would mean he took 2 100mg pills. This is not a 100% lethal dose if taken alone.\n\nDesmethylsertraline: This is an active metabolite of sertraline. 1.6 ug/g -> 104 mg total. This would mean your father took more pills than I originally thought, as part of the sertraline taken was metabolised into its active form at the time of death. I would hazard a guess he took 3 100 mg pills of sertraline.\n\nPropiomazine: an antihistamine prescribed for treating insomnia or relieving anxiety, for instance before a surgery. Risk or severity of adverse effects of this drug can be increased by sertraline. These effects include seizure, high or low blood pressure, fast or irregular heart beat, difficulty or unusually fast breathing, muscle stiffness, unusually pale skin, excessive sweating, loss of bladder control and unusual tiredness or weakness. 1.9 milligram total. It is only available as injectable drug at 20mg/ml.\n\nDihydropropiomazine: active metabolite of propiomazine. 7.1 milligram total. I would guess 0,5 ml of propiomazine was injected, making the total dose 10 mg.\n\nAripiprazol: a.k.a Abilify. Antipsychotic medication prescribed for managing schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and, together with other drugs, major depressive disorder. 9.7 mg total found. Sertraline raises blood levels of this drug by increasing the rate of absorption. This can cause increased side effects of abilify, including drowsiness, seizure, parkinson-like tremors, low blood pressure. \n\nZopiklon: A sleeping pill. 7.1 mg total, which is close to what is expected after taking 10 mg. Sertraline decreases the metabolism of zopiclone, which means it will stay in the body for a longer time. Zopliclone increases the CNS-depressant effects of Propiomazine. Together with aripiprazol, risk or severity of adverse effects can increase. Adverse effects of zopiclone include memory problems, breathing difficulty, sleep-walking, depressed mood. \n\nSo, long story short. It is unlikely that sertraline alone has caused the death of your father. It is more likely that the interactions between drugs have caused such severe side effects that your father did not survive. Most likely suspects: interactions between propiomazine and sertraline, aripiprazol and zopiklon, aripiprazol and sertraline.\n\nCan you find out how your father got propiomazine in his system? This is a drug that is only injected, either intravenous or intramuscular. The other drugs are all available in pill form and can be taken at home.\n\nEDIT: added a few details.\n\nEDIT2 at the request of /u/CrimsonSuede: I do not believe this was a suicide. I do believe this was a combination of drug interactions and the consequences of thrombosis."

    "response": "All of your symptoms are vague and nonspecific, which means a diagnosis is difficult. \n\nTypically when a patient has nonspecific symptoms in multiple organ systems, that typically means the answer is a somatization disorder. This is when stresses on the mind are experienced as physical symptoms. \n\nBut somatization is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning we have to rule out other dangerous things before we can blame the symptoms on the mind. \n\nThere are very few diseases that can cause symptoms in so many organ systems. But there are some, and so these would need to be ruled out. But that\u2019s impossible to do over the internet, so you should see your physician to get an exam. \n\n\nAlso I highly doubt your symptoms are related to the vaccine. There has been no association with any disease that could explain your symptoms. Billions of people have been vaccinated. At the same time, People develop strange symptoms and diseases all the time and have always done so. The problem is now everybody with a strange disease or symptom happens to have recently received the vaccine. The consequence of this is that my patients, people on this subreddit, and all over the internet continue to ask if they\u2019re new symptom is related to the vaccine. health professionals and statisticians scrutinize the data and look for a correlation to the vaccine. but all it takes to dissuade a vaccine hesitant person to look at 4-5 posts on the internet describing people with strange symptoms innocently asking if they\u2019re related to the vaccine. \n\n\nSo, for anybody reading this I\u2019ll reiterate. The vaccine is safe. It did not cause OP\u2019s symptoms. You take more of a risk every single day getting into your car and driving to work than you do by getting a single vaccine."

    "document": "Population-wide persistent hemostatic changes after vaccination with ChAdOx1-S\nVarious vaccines were developed to reduce the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cov-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Quickly after the start of vaccination, reports emerged that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including ChAdOx1-S, could be associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. We investigated the hemostatic changes after ChAdOx1-S vaccination in 631 health care workers. Blood samples were collected 32 days on average after the second ChAdOx1-S vaccination, to evaluate hemostatic markers such as D-dimer, fibrinogen, \u03b12-macroglobulin, FVIII and thrombin generation. Endothelial function was assessed by measuring Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and active VWF. IL-6 and IL-10 were measured to study the activation of the immune system. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleoside and anti-spike protein antibody titers were determined. Prothrombin and fibrinogen levels were significantly reduced after vaccination (\u22127.5% and \u221216.9%,  p  < 0.0001). Significantly more vaccinated subjects were outside the normal range compared to controls for prothrombin (42.1% vs. 26.4%,  p  = 0.026) and antithrombin (23.9% vs. 3.6%,  p  = 0.0010). Thrombin generation indicated a more procoagulant profile, characterized by a significantly shortened lag time (\u221211.3%,  p  < 0.0001) and time-to-peak (\u221213.0% and  p  < 0.0001) and an increased peak height (32.6%,  p  = 0.0015) in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated controls. Increased VWF (+39.5%,  p  < 0.0001) and active VWF levels (+24.1 %,  p  < 0.0001) pointed toward endothelial activation, and IL-10 levels were significantly increased (9.29 pg/mL vs. 2.43 pg/mL,  p  = 0.032). The persistent increase of IL-10 indicates that the immune system remains active after ChAdOx1-S vaccination. This could trigger a pathophysiological mechanism causing an increased thrombin generation profile and vascular endothelial activation, which could subsequently result in and increased risk of thrombotic events.",

    "question": "23 year old female, 140 pounds, 5'8\". Non-smoker and I have some back issues - spina bifida occulata and sacralization (of lumbar 5 I think). \n\nI sit for long periods of time at work (involves lots of reading, writing, and staying at my computer) and lead a generally sedentary lifestyle at the moment. I've read all about the dangers of sitting for too long though, and it's starting to freak me out. I'm worried about the damage potentially done to my back as well as the damage to my overall health and mortality risk. This has prompted a few questions:  \n\n1. Can exercise - particularly shorter workouts consisting of high intensity interval training - offset the damage of sitting for long periods of time? Or does it not matter if you exercise 5% of the time if the other 95% of the time you're sitting?\n2. Would getting a small cycling machine that fits under a desk be a good way to offset the damage of sitting for long periods of time? Or does this not matter, as you're still in the general sitting position. \n3. Given my pre-existing back issues which are starting to give me lower back pain, would doing targeted exercises and stretches to strengthen my core and open up my hips (I've done some research and have found *tons* of exercises and stretches that supposedly help with lower back pain) be enough to stave off the damage done by sitting for long periods of time? Or, once again, does it not matter if I'm doing exercises to strengthen my core and correct my posture 5% of the time if I'm still sitting for most of my day?\n\nI've been looking into lumbar pillows and exercise guides specifically designed to help with lower back pain. While I feel like this might be able to at least improve some of my back pain, I'm still very concerned about the risks of sitting for long periods of time, and whether or not the damage done to your overall health and mortality risk is something that can't be avoided (regardless of how much you exercise during the periods where you aren't sitting). \n\nThank you for any advice.",

    "document": "Executive (dys)function after traumatic brain injury: special considerations for behavioral pharmacology\nExecutive function is an umbrella term that includes cognitive processes such as decision-making, impulse control, attention, behavioral flexibility, and working memory. Each of these processes depends largely upon monoaminergic (dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic) neurotransmission in the frontal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, among other brain areas. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces disruptions in monoaminergic signaling along several steps in the neurotransmission process \u2013 synthesis, distribution, and breakdown \u2013 and in turn, produces long-lasting deficits in several executive function domains. Understanding how TBI alters monoamingeric neurotransmission and executive function will advance basic knowledge of the underlying principles that govern executive function and potentially further treatment of cognitive deficits following such injury. In this review, we examine the influence of TBI on the following measures of executive function \u2013 impulsivity, behavioral flexibility, and working memory. We also describe monoaminergic-systems changes following TBI. Given that TBI patients experience alterations in monoaminergic signaling following injury, they may represent a unique population with regard to pharmacotherapy. We conclude this review by discussing some considerations for pharmacotherapy in the field of TBI.",

    "document": "Individualized Treatment Guidelines for Postpubertal Cryptorchidism\nCryptorchidism is a well-known congenital anomaly in children. However, its diagnosis is often delayed for reasons including patient unawareness or denial of abnormal findings in the testis. Moreover, it has been difficult to establish an optimal treatment strategy for postpubertal cryptorchidism, given the small number of patients. Unlike cryptorchidism in children, postpubertal cryptorchidism is associated with an increased probability of neoplasms, which has led orchiectomy to be the recommended treatment. However, routine orchiectomy should be avoided in some cases due to quality-of-life issues and the potential risk of perioperative mortality. Based on a literature review, this study proposes individualized treatment guidelines for postpubertal cryptorchidism.",

Sleep and anthropometric parameters at baseline and follow-up (up to 22 mo) were examined and compared between obese and nonobese patients with a diagnosis of OSA (apnea-hypopnea index > 5 events/h sleep). A key nonanatomical contributor to OSA pathogenesis, the respiratory arousal threshold, was compared between groups. \n           \n           \n             Results: \n             Twenty-five percent of the participants with a diagnosis of OSA had a body mass index (BMI) within the normal range (BMI < 25 kg/m 2 ) and 54% had a BMI < 30 kg/m 2  (nonobese). Of the patients prescribed continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), more nonobese patients reported not using their CPAP machine at all at follow-up (36% vs. 13%, p = 0.03). Objective CPAP compliance was also lower in the nonobese patients with OSA (5.1 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 6.4 \u00b1 0.4 h/night, p < 0.03). A higher proportion of the nonobese patients had a low respiratory arousal threshold compared to obese OSA patients (86% vs. 60%, p < 0.001). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions: \n             A substantial proportion of patients with OSA are not obese. These patients are challenging to treat with existing therapies as they are less adherent and compliant with CPAP therapy. Nonanatomical contributors to OSA, such a low threshold for arousal, are likely to be particularly important in OSA pathogenesis in nonobese patients with OSA.

This is the first randomized, controlled trial comparing the manualized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program with an active control for Generalized Anxiety Disorder, a disorder characterized by chronic worry and physiological hyperarousal symptoms. \n           \n           \n             Method \n             Ninety-three individuals with DSM-IV-diagnosed GAD were randomized to an 8-week group intervention with MBSR or to an attention control, Stress Management Education (SME) between 2009 and 2011. Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A, primary outcome measure), the Clinical Global Impression of Severity and Improvement (CGI-S and CGI-I), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Stress reactivity was assessed by comparing anxiety and distress during pre- and post-treatment Trier Social Stress Tests (TSST). \n           \n           \n             Results \n             A modified intent-to-treat analysis including participants who completed at least one session of MBSR (N=48) or SME (N=41) showed that both interventions led to significant reductions in HAM-A scores at endpoint, but did not significantly differ. MBSR, however, was associated with a significantly greater reduction in anxiety as measured by the CGI-S, the CGI-I, and the BAI (all  P s<0.05). MBSR was also associated with greater reductions than SME in anxiety and distress ratings in response to the TSST stress challenge ( P <0.05), and a greater increase in positive self-statements ( P =0.004). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             These results suggest that MBSR may have a beneficial effect on anxiety symptoms in GAD, and may also improve stress reactivity and coping as measured in a laboratory stress challenge.",

Can my memory return to normal? And how much will going through abstinence affect me at this stage.

    "document": "Neuropsychological performance in young adults with cannabis use\ndisorder\nBackground and Aims: \n             Cannabis is a commonly used recreational drug in young adults. The worldwide\nprevalence in 18- to 25-year-olds is approximately 35%. Significant\ndifferences in cognitive performance have been reported previously for\ngroups of cannabis users. However, the groups are often heterogeneous in\nterms of cannabis use. Here, we study daily cannabis users with a confirmed\ndiagnosis of cannabis use disorder (CUD) to examine cognitive performance on\nmeasures of memory, executive function and risky decision-making. \n           \n           \n             Methods: \n             Forty young adult daily cannabis users with diagnosed CUD and 20 healthy\ncontrols matched for sex and premorbid intelligence quotient (IQ) were\nincluded. The neuropsychological battery implemented was designed to measure\nmultiple modes of memory (visual, episodic and working memory), risky\ndecision-making and other domains of executive function using subtests from\nthe Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). \n           \n           \n             Results: \n             Our results showed that young adult daily cannabis users with CUD perform\nsignificantly poorer on tasks of visual and episodic memory compared with\nhealthy controls. In addition, executive functioning was associated with the\nage of onset. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions: \n             Further research is required to determine whether worse performance in\ncognition results in cannabis use or is a consequence of cannabis use.\nChronic heavy cannabis use during a critical period of brain development may\nhave a particularly negative impact on cognition. Research into the\npersistence of cognitive differences and how they relate to functional\noutcomes such as academic/career performance is required.",
    "response": "Three years of heavy use is unlikely to have a huge long term effect.  Most effects are related to current use, and abstinence for at least a month is associated with substantial improvement in performance.  However, there are certainly reports of serious long term memory problems in heavy users during adolescence.  The sooner people start smoking heavily, the stronger the effect:\n\n[\n\nHowever, it's a pretty complex issue.  Many cannabis users are self-medicating and have dual diagnoses such as anxiety or depression.  These can significantly affect memory and other measures of executive function as well.  \n\nBut to answer your question, nobody really knows the long term effects.  We don't know the magnitude of the effect long term, and we don't know how long it lasts.  It's nearly impossible to predict in a single individual the long term effects of heavy use for a few years in adolescence.  Some people have no effects, in fact probably most. \n\nYour best bet is to abstain from cannabis starting now.  There is no withdrawal syndrome that will affect your health, although some people have appetite / nausea for a few days or weeks when stopping cold turkey.  You should also get hooked up with a substance abuse program.  They can help support the underlying anxiety that is mixed in with all this.  \n\nYou've taken an important step.  You've realized there's a problem.  You'll likely be fine if you address things now."

In adults, there were several attempts to restore the stiff joints into mobile ones, but these treatment options resulted in poor outcomes and could not be applied to growing children. Here, we report our experiences on surgical treatment for children who had symphalangism of the hand. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We treated 36 joints in 17 children with symphalangism of the hand using dorsal capsulotomy and collateral ligament release. The diagnoses were based on history, physical examination, and simple radiographs. Affected fingers were classified according to our grading system. Simple compressive dressing was applied using Coban after surgery. Passive range of motion (ROM) exercise was started on day one or 2 postoperative, with the help of a hand therapist and patients' parents.

I have been putting on weight for some time now, doctors have Said this gain could be due to the PCOS, however over 15lbs of the 30 or so I\u2019ve gained in the last year has been in the last two months. And I\u2019ve been actively trying to lose weight, even taking Contrave (bupropion/naltrexone) to help with my appetite. I also have a mirena IUD for BC and take spironolactone and Slynd (progesterone only oral BC) for cystic acne. They Slynd I\u2019ve only been taking for three months.  \n\n\nSymptoms: Aside from the weight gain, I have one breast that has rapidly grown in size (it seemed to happen in the span of about four days) and is now over a cup size bigger than the other. Both breasts suddenly have increased vein prominence, some blueish discoloration (almost like bruising), I\u2019ve had red dots appear on the skin and the skin on my upper chest suddenly feels bumpy and scaley, and both are very sore and aching. Both have leaked completely clear discharge from the nipples when lightly expressed. Under my arms and into my back are quite sore as well. I feel generally tired as well.\n\nI went to see a midwife in OBGYN for the first available appointment And she found a lump on the larger breast. I\u2019m scheduled for an ultrasound on the 30th. However, when I left a message to say that they had become even more sore and to inform her about the new discharge, I was called by a nurse, told the midwife spoke to some doctors, and they wanted me seen in general surgery that day (this past Thursday).\n\nThe surgeon I saw was very rushed (they must have squeezed me in) and did an improper breast exam, not even feeling where I told him the lump had been found. He told me \u201cnothing I was experiencing was a symptom of cancer.\u201d And I \u201cshouldn\u2019t lose sleep over it.\u201d He offered to give me antibiotics but said he \u201cwasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d be treating\u201d so I refused them. He told me if I just lost 35-45lbs a lot of my \u201cproblems would go away\u201d. He questioned whether or not I showered everyday. He was accusatory, telling me the timeline of my breast growth \u201cjust didn\u2019t make sense\u201d. I told him well, yeah, that\u2019s why it\u2019s concerning. He told me to see an endocrinologist for my hormones and weight and suggested cosmetic surgery for both my increased unilateral breast size and my weight.\n\nI was offended. I felt ignored. I felt confused. Why was I told to rush in just to be blown off like that? I know from researching that these can all be symptoms of breast cancer. I feel like my symptoms are all being blamed on my weight rather than thinking about how sudden and rapid the weight gain was and that it may possibly be a symptom not the problem. \n\nI\u2019m hoping this is a hormone issue, maybe due to the PCOS, but am afraid it\u2019s something worse, like breast cancer.\n\n I feel at a loss right now. So many questions. How do I deal with what I feel is weight discrimination in a medical setting? Are these symptoms more concerning than doctors are letting on? What hormonal issue could cause these problems, if it is that? Why have the doctors been dodging my questions about it being cancer? Has anyone else experienced anything like this?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",

    "response": "Lots of possibilities here. Nothing sounds suspiciously like breast cancer to me (rapid cup size changes are not typical for breast cancer, and spironolactone may be a big confounder here).

I\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD since the early 00\u2019s, however I did not start medication for it until 2016. In February of 2018, my weight cycled between 110lbs and 125lbs. I went on Nexplanon in March of 2018. By June of 2018, I was 180lbs. The Doctor who put in the Nexplanon told me that there was no way it was the Nexplanon, and it had to be my diet of 1 packet of ramen and 1 large iced coffee per day, which was about 1000kcals/day. (I don\u2019t have an ED, I promise, my Adderall just *kills* my appetite.) I had the Nexplanon pulled out in March of 2019.\n\nFor the last year and a half or so, I\u2019ve been eating primarily veggies and meat, a little dairy (Greek Yogurt,kefir, occasional cheese), all between 1200 and 1600 kcals. 6 days out of 7 in a caloric deficit, primarily protein and healthy fats. My only \u201cbad\u201d foods are 5oz of wine and 1 serving of dark chocolate per day. I drink 64-80oz of water every day. Scale won\u2019t budge.

I miss my body. I want kids in a couple of years, and I want to be at a healthy weight when I conceive and carry them, since I\u2019m technically obese right now. I\u2019m wondering if I should ask my doctor to prescribe Contrave or Topamax to try and get this damn weight off. I don\u2019t understand what happened or why, and my doctor is insistent that it\u2019s diet related and that I just \u201cdon\u2019t know how to record my food intake.\u201d \n\nPlease, help. I cannot do this anymore. Thank you.",
    "document": "A comprehensive diagnostic approach to detect underlying causes of obesity in adults\nSummary \n           Obesity is a worldwide growing problem. When confronted with obesity, many health care providers focus on direct treatment of the consequences of adiposity. We plead for adequate diagnostics first, followed by an individualized treatment. We provide experience\u2010based and evidence\u2010based practical recommendations (illustrated by clinical examples), to detect potential underlying diseases and contributing factors. Adult patients consulting a doctor for weight gain or obesity should first be clinically assessed for underlying diseases, such as monogenetic or syndromic obesity, hypothyroidism, (cyclic) Cushing syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), hypogonadism, growth hormone deficiency, and hypothalamic obesity. The most important alarm symptoms for genetic obesity are early onset obesity, dysmorphic features/congenital malformations with or without intellectual deficit, behavioral problems, hyperphagia, and/or striking family history. Importantly, also common contributing factors to weight gain should be investigated, including medication (mainly psychiatric drugs, (local) corticosteroids, insulin, and specific \u03b2\u2010adrenergic receptor blockers), sleeping habits and quality, crash diets and yoyo\u2010effect, smoking cessation, and alcoholism. Other associated conditions include mental factors such as chronic stress or binge\u2010eating disorder and depression.Identifying and optimizing the underlying diseases, contributing factors, and other associated conditions may not only result in more effective and personalized treatment but could also reduce the social stigma for patients with obesity.",
    "response": "First off, I'm sorry that this has been happening to you. Its for sure very frustrating especially when you've been trying hard to lose weight. \n\nThere are a number of endocrinopathies that can cause weight gain. Also a number of drugs. Certainly hormonal birth control is a notorious culprit as well. \n\nYou mention taking thyroid hormone; it at least seems like you've gotten part of an endocrine workup. I would encourage you to pursue a more comprehensive workup for hypercortisolism, hyperandrogenism, diabetes etc. See this paper that was posted in a similar thread for other ideas. \n\nAlso consider if your mental health could be involved. Atypical depression, SSRIs, antipsychotics, and other drugs or psychiatric conditions are notorious for weight gain.\n\nUnfortunately, everything above has one thing in common - caloric surplus. If your caloric intake is > your total daily energy expenditure than you will gain weight. Your TDEE is variable and affected by both metabolism and exercise, while your caloric intake is pretty much as you make of it, save for malabsorption which would be the opposite problem. Unfortunately, whether or not you have a confounding endocrine/mental health/contributing drug condition, the calorie counting must be off by some degree. If you are 5'4, 180lbs, moderate exercise than your maintenance TDEE is 2400 calories. Simply put somewhere extra calories are appearing +/- an additional endocrine/hormonal/contributing factor. \n\nThe only other way to be gaining weight without caloric surplus is water retention. Usually only seen in congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and end stage kidney disease. \n\n\nRegarding weight loss drugs - ozempic was recently approved for weight loss. It is very effective but so new that it might be terribly expensive."

    "document": "The bacterial consortia promote plant growth and secondary metabolite accumulation in Astragalus mongholicus under drought stress\nAstragalus mongholicus  is a widely used Traditional Chinese Medicine. However, cultivated  A. mongholicus  is often threatened by water shortage at all growth stage, and the content of medicinal compounds of cultivated  A. mongholicus  is much lower than that of wild plants. To alleviate drought stress on  A. mongholicus  and improve the accumulation of medicinal components in roots of  A. mongholicus , we combined different bacteria with plant growth promotion or abiotic stress resistance characteristics and evaluated the role of bacterial consortium in helping plants tolerate drought stress and improving medicinal component content in roots simultaneously. Through the determination of 429 bacterial strains, it was found that 97 isolates had phosphate solubilizing ability, 63 isolates could release potassium from potash feldspar, 123 isolates could produce IAA, 58 isolates could synthesize ACC deaminase, and 21 isolates could secret siderophore. Eight bacterial consortia were constructed with 25 bacterial isolates with more than three functions or strong growth promoting ability, and six out of eight bacterial consortia significantly improved the root dry weight. However, only consortium 6 could increase the root biomass, astragaloside IV and calycosin-7-glucoside content in roots simultaneously. Under drought challenge, the consortium 6 could still perform these functions. Compared with non-inoculated plants, the root dry weight of consortium inoculated-plants increased by 120.0% and 78.8% under mild and moderate drought stress, the total content of astragaloside IV increased by 183.83% and 164.97% under moderate and severe drought stress, calycosin-7-glucoside content increased by 86.60%, 148.56% and 111.45% under mild, moderate and severe drought stress, respectively. Meanwhile, consortium inoculation resulted in a decrease in MDA level, while soluble protein and proline content and SOD, POD and CAT activities increased. These findings provide novel insights about multiple bacterial combinations to improve drought stress responses and contribute to accumulate more medicinal compounds. \n           \n             Supplementary information \n             The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12870-022-03859-4.",

When I was 26 I awoke one morning after a heavy night of drinking to a bout of painful burning diarrhea. I thought it was from the drinking but it never went away. I went to my GP and was told I had Hpilor and gastritis. was prescribed an antibiotic and a PPI and sent on my way. six months later I still had the diarrhea and was referred to a gastro. an endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed which said everything looked good but I had a small Hiatal hernia. I was told to continue on my PPI and make changes to my diet to include more fiber. Fast forward 2 years. I awoke to right side rib pain and every time I ate I vomited up frothy Mucos. I was sent for an ultrasound and had small gallstones. My gastro convinced me they were the culprit and ordered my gallbladder removed. around this time I started having premature atrial contractions.  This made my IBS-D go Nuclear.  I was put on cohlostramine told to not eat fried foods and sent on my way. fast forward to 35. I awoke one morning to go on vacation and I started having severe chest pains.  was put on an EKG and assured I was not, in fact, having a heart attack prescribed Stronger PPI's and sent on my way. The chest pains continued I was given another endoscopy and another colonoscopy. I was informed that my hernia had grown slightly and I now had fresh scarring on my esophagus. A Ph bravo test was ordered and I wore a monitor for several days it reported back sever instances of acid reflux. About three months later I found myself in the ER with severe lower left rib pain I was diagnosed with pancreatitis was told there was nothing they could really do and was instructed to not drink and drink plenty of water and follow up with my GP or gastro the problem slowly went away and that thank god never happened again. It was at this point that I started having severe muscle and joint pain along with my neurological symptoms. I started having a week long PAC episodes and went to see a cardiologist. after wearing a monitor it was determined I needed a nuclear stress test. the Stress test came back abnormal and a heart cath was ordered. the Cardiologist said after the cath my heart was clear and looked extremely healthy with no buildup or abnormalities. At this point, I was so fed up with medicine I gave up and just tried to ignore it all. my PAC's sucked but weren't going to kill me and the Dihreah was manageable altho I had several incidents of soiling myself and it was embarrassing on occasion. I changed my diet completely gave up sugar, caffeine, and fried foods and began taking vitamins and probiotics.  things got better for about half a year until I started waking up with severe muscle cramps dizzy spells and others on the list and also having to pee throughout the night now.

    "document": "Hiatal Hernia Is Associated With an Increased Prevalence of Atrial Fibrillation in Young Patients\nPurpose:  Hiatal hernia (HH) causes protrusion of the stomach into the chest cavity, directly impinging on the left atrium and possibly increasing predisposition to atrial arrhythmogenesis. However, such association has not been fully explored. The objective was to determine if an association between HH and atrial fibrillation (AF) exists and whether there are age- and sex-related differences. \n           Methods:  Adult patients diagnosed with HH from 1976 to 2006 at Mayo Clinic Rochester, Minnesota, were evaluated for AF. The number of patients with AF and HH was compared to age- and sex-matched patients with AF reported in the general population. Long-term outcomes were compared to corresponding county and state populations. \n           Results:  During the 30-year period, 111,429 patients were diagnosed with HH (mean age 61.4 \u00b1 13.8 years, 47.9% male) and 7,865 patients (7.1%) also had a diagnosis of AF (mean age 73.1 \u00b1 10.5 years; 55% male). In younger patients (<55 years), the occurrence of AF was 17.5-fold higher in men with HH and 19-fold higher in women with HH compared to the frequency of AF reported in the general population. Incidence of heart failure for patients with AF and HH was worse compared to the overall county population, but better than for those with AF. Similarly, mortality was worse in patients with AF and HH compared to the overall state population, but better than for those with AF in the county. \n           Conclusion:  Hiatal hernia appears to be associated with increased frequency of AF in both men and women of all age groups, but particularly in young patients. Further studies are needed to investigate this possible association and underlying mechanism.",

    "question": "My wife (32F, \\~125lbs) began having some concerning symptoms in mid-May.  Prior to this she's had no major health issues and relatively few minor ones other than very mild psoriasis on the scalp.  She is a medical professional working in a small clinic, and her PCP is one of her coworkers.  I am not a medical professional of any kind.  We have been working closely with her PCP (who we greatly respect and trust) on this, and everyone seems stumped.  \n\nThis is going to be long.\n\nThe first symptoms she had in mid-May were gastric.  We initially put this down to some kind of GI bug.  The symptoms came on while she was at work and she stayed home the next day.  Over the next couple days the GI symptoms abated, but she got very tired.  Over the weekend she woke up gasping for breath at one point, but after that had no problems other than tiredness.  On Monday when I got home from work she was napping and she had an extremely fast breathing rate.  When she woke up she was gasping for breath.  We called her PCP and were told to go to the ER, with suspicions of COVID.  At the ER she got a chest X-ray, CT, EKG, lab work, COVID test, the whole 9 yards.  They found nothing abnormal and sent her home.  She continued to have weakness, to the point she could barely drag herself across the house.  \n\nAfter the COVID test came back negative on Wednesday, her PCP called in another doc who asked a few questions over the phone and recommended a neuro exam.  We went in to see her PCP for this and her PCP found significant left-side motor and sensory deficits.  The next day my wife was in for an MRI of her brain down through her thoracic spine, with and without contrast.  That came back completely clean.  The day after we were in a neurologists office for an EMG and full neurological workup.  The EMG came back normal and the neurological exam didn't show deficits as significant as before.  The neurologist basically said \"I'm not telling you there's not a problem, because clearly something isn't right.  I'm just telling you that it's not obvious enough for me to see and diagnose it.\"\n\nAt this point some more labs were drawn, looking for auto-immune markers.  Her ANA came back weakly positive, and her thyroid antibodies (I can't remember the specific name) came back in the high 400s.  Her PCP said it looks like Hashimoto's, and started her on levothyroxine and said to give it some time.  This would be right around the end of May I think at this point.  She also had somewhat low vitamin B and started a supplement that, as of most recent labs, has gotten her back to normal.  We made it into July with basically no change.  We started seeing an up and down pattern of her having a \"good\" day where she didn't feel like she was just going to collapse and die, followed by a really crappy day, then a couple mediocre days.  The left-side deficits seem to come and go as well.\n\nWe train in BJJ, and our coach was a personal trainer at one point.  She set up weekly personal training with him and he could easily tell the left-side deficits when putting her through her paces.  Her PCP's thought at this point is that because we're so physically active and fit, she's just been compensating really well for the deficits, explaining why we didn't notice them before.  There's no telling how long it had been happening.  She is still continuing these weekly sessions, and while she's compensating even better for the deficits and can still practice BJJ, they're still obvious.\n\nIn July she met with her PCP again, having just had a couple really bad days, and they both agreed that she's still getting worse overall.  Because they work closely together her PCP knows how my wife acts and works, and can tell that she's not getting better at all.  At this point her PCP gave her a few options, and they both agreed on Plaquanil/hydroxychloroquine, and continuing the levothyroxine.  I think she started that right about a month ago at this point.  \n\nMy wife continued the regular pattern of good/bad with a slight trend towards the good.  It seems to us like the upward trend is most likely due to her continued physical training and conscious effort to keep working hard to stave off whatever is happening.  Unfortunately despite the treatments and effort, she took another nosedive about a week ago.  The left-side deficits became more obvious again.  Not quite as much as the first time she was tested, but I attribute this (with all my layperson knowledge) to her dedicated training.  She met with her PCP again, and her PCP asked if she wanted to try a course of relatively high-dose steroids, and they agreed.  Her PCP also ordered some more labs, with another thyroid antibody panel that came back even higher than before, in the low 500s.  \n\nIt's been about a week since she started the steroids.  We do think it's evened out the up/down pattern some, but it seems to have struck a balance around the mediocre days I mentioned earlier.  She doesn't feel as bad as she's felt, but she also doesn't feel as good as the \"good days\" she's had.  She did mention to me last night that the steroids seems to have had a positive impact on the dizziness she's experienced on and off.  She still doesn't feel super great about that, but as we trained jiu jitsu she has been avoiding any takedowns or stand-up sparring because she's not confident in her balance.  \n\n\\---------------\n\nSo at this point she's about two months into the levothyroxine, a month into the Plaquanil, and a week into the steroids.  Her thyroid antibodies are even more elevated than before.  Our coach told her about a week ago as they were training that it looks like her left hamstring is either not engaging at all or not properly.  She had me do some testing last night and I can tell there's weakness on the left side, primarily with her left hamstring, left tricep, and left back muscles.  Her biceps, quads, and chest muscles seem even.  I'm obviously not a professional though.  The way she describes feeling is that her muscles aren't weaker, they're just not doing what she wants.  She's especially having trouble on the left side, but it's not limited to that.  The peaks and valleys of her overall feeling seem to have evened out somewhat with the steroids, but she's still feeling exhausted most days, physically and mentally.  She tried a gluten and dairy-free diet for a month and that didn't seem to have any effect.  Even before that she eats relatively healthy.  Certainly better than I do.\n\nWe know it takes time for some treatments to start working, but she doesn't seem to be getting any better at all.  On the contrary it seems she's still in an overall downward spiral, and the only thing holding it off is her dedication to keep pressing forward, keep training physically, keep eating healthy, etc.  She's wearing down though.  She's trying to stay positive, but it's really wearing on her.  If we could just find an answer to what's happening, we could prepare for it.  Her thyroid is definitely involved, but MS, MG, and other things have been thrown around as well.  The not knowing is taking a toll.  If we knew it was MS, or if we knew it was MG, we could deal with it.  We'd know what it means, we'd know what the options are, and we'd be able to make a plan to deal with it and keep pushing forward.  But right now we don't know which way forward is.",

The short-term effects are similar to spontaneous menopause and refer mainly to the climacteric syndrome. In a longer perspective, POI affects a variety of aspects. It obviously and drastically reduces the chances for spontaneous pregnancies. Oestrogen loss leads also to urogenital atrophy. The most common urogenital symptoms include vaginal dryness, vaginal irritation and itching. The urogenital atrophy and hypoestrogenism interferes also with sexual functioning. Patients with POI are threatened by a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). POI women also experience psychological distress and some studies have shown an increased risk of neurodegenerating diseases. Overall, POI women have a shortened life expectancy, mainly due to cardiovascular disease. Some studies have reported a reduced risk of breast cancer in this group of patients. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             In conclusion there are several well-characterized health risks in POI women.

    "document": "Review of the Emerging Evidence Demonstrating the Efficacy of Ivermectin in the Prophylaxis and Treatment of COVID-19\nBackground: \n           After COVID-19 emerged on U.S shores, providers began reviewing the emerging basic science, translational, and clinical data to identify potentially effective treatment options. In addition, a multitude of both novel and repurposed therapeutic agents were used empirically and studied within clinical trials. \n           \n             Areas of Uncertainty: \n             The majority of trialed agents have failed to provide reproducible, definitive proof of efficacy in reducing the mortality of COVID-19 with the exception of corticosteroids in moderate to severe disease. Recently, evidence has emerged that the oral antiparasitic agent ivermectin exhibits numerous antiviral and anti-inflammatory mechanisms with trial results reporting significant outcome benefits. Given some have not passed peer review, several expert groups including Unitaid/World Health Organization have undertaken a systematic global effort to contact all active trial investigators to rapidly gather the data needed to grade and perform meta-analyses. \n           \n           \n             Data Sources: \n             Data were sourced from published peer-reviewed studies, manuscripts posted to preprint servers, expert meta-analyses, and numerous epidemiological analyses of regions with ivermectin distribution campaigns. \n           \n           \n             Therapeutic Advances: \n             A large majority of randomized and observational controlled trials of ivermectin are reporting repeated, large magnitude improvements in clinical outcomes. Numerous prophylaxis trials demonstrate that regular ivermectin use leads to large reductions in transmission. Multiple, large \u201cnatural experiments\u201d occurred in regions that initiated \u201civermectin distribution\u201d campaigns followed by tight, reproducible, temporally associated decreases in case counts and case fatality rates compared with nearby regions without such campaigns. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions: \n             Meta-analyses based on 18 randomized controlled treatment trials of ivermectin in COVID-19 have found large, statistically significant reductions in mortality, time to clinical recovery, and time to viral clearance. Furthermore, results from numerous controlled prophylaxis trials report significantly reduced risks of contracting COVID-19 with the regular use of ivermectin. Finally, the many examples of ivermectin distribution campaigns leading to rapid population-wide decreases in morbidity and mortality indicate that an oral agent effective in all phases of COVID-19 has been identified.",

    "document": "Prediction of COVID-19 Infections for Municipalities in the Netherlands: Algorithm Development and Interpretation\nBackground \n             COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China. The virus quickly spread and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. After infection, symptoms such as fever, a (dry) cough, nasal congestion, and fatigue can develop. In some cases, the virus causes severe complications such as pneumonia and dyspnea and could result in death. The virus also spread rapidly in the Netherlands, a small and densely populated country with an aging population. Health care in the Netherlands is of a high standard, but there were nevertheless problems with hospital capacity, such as the number of available beds and staff. There were also regions and municipalities that were hit harder than others. In the Netherlands, there are important data sources available for daily COVID-19 numbers and information about municipalities. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             We aimed to predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands, using a data set with the properties of 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and advanced modeling techniques. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We collected relevant static data per municipality from data sources that were available in the Dutch public domain and merged these data with the dynamic daily number of infections from January 1, 2020, to May 9, 2021, resulting in a data set with 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and variables grouped into 20 topics. The modeling techniques random forest and multiple fractional polynomials were used to construct a prediction model for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The final prediction model had an  R 2  of 0.63. Important properties for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality in the Netherlands were exposure to particulate matter with diameters <10 \u03bcm (PM10) in the air, the percentage of Labour party voters, and the number of children in a household. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Data about municipality properties in relation to the cumulative number of confirmed infections in a municipality in the Netherlands can give insight into the most important properties of a municipality for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality. This insight can provide policy makers with tools to cope with COVID-19 and may also be of value in the event of a future pandemic, so that municipalities are better prepared.",

    "document": "Noradrenergic Mechanisms in Fentanyl-Mediated Rapid Death Explain Failure of Naloxone in the Opioid Crisis\nIn December 2018, the Centers for Disease Control declared fentanyl the deadliest drug in America. Opioid overdose is the single greatest cause of death in the United States adult population (ages 18\u201350), and fentanyl and its analogs [fentanyl/fentanyl analogs (F/FAs)] are currently involved in >50% of these deaths. Anesthesiologists in the United States were introduced to fentanyl in the early 1970s when it revolutionized surgical anesthesia by combining profound analgesia with hemodynamic stability. However, they quickly had to master its unique side effect. F/FAs can produce profound rigidity in the diaphragm, chest wall and upper airway within an extremely narrow dosing range. This clinical effect was called wooden chest syndrome (WCS) by anesthesiologists and is not commonly known outside of anesthesiology or to clinicians or researchers in addiction research/medicine. WCS is almost routinely fatal without expert airway management. This review provides relevant clinical human pharmacology and animal data demonstrating that the significant increase in the number of F/FA-induced deaths may involve  \u03b1 -adrenergic and cholinergic receptor\u2013mediated mechanical failure of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems with rapid development of rigidity and airway closure. Although morphine and its prodrug, heroin, can cause mild rigidity in abdominal muscles at high doses, neither presents with the distinct and rapid respiratory failure seen with F/FA-induced WCS, separating F/FA overdose from the slower onset of respiratory depression caused by morphine-derived alkaloids. This distinction has significant consequences for the design and implementation of new pharmacologic strategies to effectively prevent F/FA-induced death. \n           \n             SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT \n             Deaths from fentanyl and F/FAs are increasing in spite of availability and awareness of the opioid reversal drug naloxone. This article reviews literature suggesting that naloxone may be ineffective against centrally mediated noradrenergic and cholinergic effects of F/FAs, which clinically manifest as severe muscle rigidity and airway compromise (e.g., wooden chest syndrome) that is rapid and distinct from respiratory depression seen with morphine-derived alkaloids. A physiologic model is proposed and implications for new drug development and treatment are discussed.",

    "document": "A phosphorylated transcription factor regulates sterol biosynthesis in Fusarium graminearum\nSterol biosynthesis is controlled by transcription factor SREBP in many eukaryotes. Here, we show that SREBP orthologs are not involved in the regulation of sterol biosynthesis in  Fusarium graminearum , a fungal pathogen of cereal crops worldwide. Instead, sterol production is controlled in this organism by a different transcription factor, FgSR, that forms a homodimer and binds to a 16-bp  cis -element of its target gene promoters containing two conserved CGAA repeat sequences. FgSR is phosphorylated by the MAP kinase FgHog1, and the phosphorylated FgSR interacts with the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF at the target genes, leading to enhanced transcription. Interestingly, FgSR orthologs exist only in  Sordariomycetes  and  Leotiomycetes  fungi. Additionally, FgSR controls virulence mainly via modulating deoxynivalenol biosynthesis and responses to phytoalexin. \n        \n           The fungus  Fusarium graminearum  is a pathogen of cereal crops.

Ejaculation frequency at age 40\u201349 yr was positively associated with age-standardized body mass index, physical activity, divorce, history of sexually transmitted infections, and consumption of total calories and alcohol. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test utilization by 2008, number of PSA tests, and frequency of prostate biopsy were similar across frequency categories.

    "document": "Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and its influence on women\u2019s health\nIntroduction \n             Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is one of the most common causes of secondary amenorrhea. There are three types of FHA: weight loss-related, stress-related, and exercise-related amenorrhea. FHA results from the aberrations in pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion, which in turn causes impairment of the gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone). The final consequences are complex hormonal changes manifested by profound hypoestrogenism. Additionally, these patients present mild hypercortisolemia, low serum insulin levels, low insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and low total triiodothyronine. \n           \n           \n             Aim \n             The aim of this work is to review the available data concerning the effects of FHA on different aspects of women\u2019s health. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is related to profound impairment of reproductive functions including anovulation and infertility. Women\u2019s health in this disorder is disturbed in several aspects including the skeletal system, cardiovascular system, and mental problems. Patients manifest a decrease in bone mass density, which is related to an increase in fracture risk. Therefore, osteopenia and osteoporosis are the main long-term complications of FHA. Cardiovascular complications include endothelial dysfunction and abnormal changes in the lipid profile. FHA patients present significantly higher depression and anxiety and also sexual problems compared to healthy subjects. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             FHA patients should be carefully diagnosed and properly managed to prevent both short- and long-term medical consequences.",

    "document": "The Dental Amalgam Toxicity Fear: A Myth or Actuality\nAmalgam has been used in dentistry since about 150 years and is still being used due to its low cost, ease of application, strength, durability, and bacteriostatic effect. When aesthetics is not a concern it can be used in individuals of all ages, in stress bearing areas, foundation for cast-metal and ceramic restorations and poor oral hygiene conditions. Besides all, it has other advantages like if placed under ideal conditions, it is more durable and long lasting and least technique sensitive of all restorative materials, but, concern has been raised that amalgam causes mercury toxicity. Mercury is found in the earth's crust and is ubiquitous in the environment, so even without amalgam restorations everyone is exposed to small but measurable amount of mercury in blood and urine. Dental amalgam restorations may raise these levels slightly, but this has no practical or clinical significance. The main exposure to mercury from dental amalgam occurs during placement or removal of restoration in the tooth. Once the reaction is complete less amount of mercury is released, and that is far below the current health standard. Though amalgam is capable of producing delayed hypersensitivity reactions in some individuals, if the recommended mercury hygiene procedures are followed the risks of adverse health effects could be minimized. For this review the electronic databases and PubMed were used as data sources and have been evaluated to produce the facts regarding amalgam's safety and toxicity.",

    "document": "Primary erythromelalgia: a review\nPrimary erythromelalgia (PE ORPHA90026) is a rare autosomal dominant neuropathy characterized by the combination of recurrent burning pain, warmth and redness of the extremities. The incidence rate of PE ranges from 0.36 to 1.1 per 100,000 persons. Gender ratio differs according to different studies and no evidence showed a gender preference. Clinical onset of PE is often in the first decade of life. Burning pain is the most predominant symptom and is usually caused and precipitated by warmth and physical activities. Reported cases of PE contain both inherited and sporadic forms. Genetic etiology of PE is mutations on  SCN9A , the encoding gene of a voltage-gated sodium channel subtype Nav1.7. Diagnosis of PE is made upon clinical manifestations and screening for\u00a0mutations on  SCN9A . Exclusion of several other treatable diseases/secondary erythromelalgia is also necessary because of the lack of biomarkers specifically for PE. Differential diagnoses can include Fabry disease, cellulites, Raynaud phenomenon, vasculitis and so on. Diagnostic methods often involve complete blood count, imaging studies and thermograph. Treatment for PE is unsatisfactory and highly individualized. Frequently used pain relieving drugs involve sodium channel blockers such as lidocaine, carbamazepine and mexiletine. Novel drugs such as PF-05089771 and TV-45070 could be promising in ameliorating pain symptoms due to their Nav1.7 selectivity. Patients\u2019 symptoms often worsen over time and many patients develop ulcerations and gangrenes caused by excessive exposure to low temperature in order to relieve pain.

Other subtypes are idiopathic EM and secondary EM. The management of pain in EM is challenging as no single therapy has been found to be effective. There is varying response to pharmacotherapy and significant variability within this clinical population, resulting in a stepwise trial and error approach.

    "document": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Cardiovascular Disease: Role of the Metabolic Syndrome and Its Components\nAlthough obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease have common risk factors, epidemiologic studies show that sleep apnea increases risks for cardiovascular disease independently of individuals' demographic characteristics (i.e., age, sex, and race) or risk markers (i.e., smoking, alcohol, obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension). Individuals with severe sleep apnea are at increased risk for coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and stroke. The underlying mechanisms explaining associations between obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease are not entirely delineated. Several intermediary mechanisms might be involved including sustained sympathetic activation, intrathoracic pressure changes, and oxidative stress. Other abnormalities such as disorders in coagulation factors, endothelial damage, platelet activation, and increased inflammatory mediators might also play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Linkage between obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease is corroborated by evidence that treatment of sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure reduces systolic blood pressure, improves left ventricular systolic function, and diminishes platelet activation. Several systematic studies are necessary to explicate complex associations between sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease, which may be compounded by the involvement of diseases comprising the metabolic syndrome (i.e., central obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia). Large-scale, population-based studies testing causal models linking among sleep apnea, cardiovascular morbidity, and metabolic syndrome are needed. \n           \n             Citation: \n             Jean-Louis G; Zizi F; Clark LT; Brown CD; McFarlane SI.

    "document": "Alcohol disrupts sleep homeostasis\nAlcohol is a potent somnogen and one of the most commonly used \u201cover the counter\u201d sleep aids. In healthy non-alcoholics, acute alcohol decreases sleep latency, consolidates and increases the quality (delta power) and quantity of NREM sleep during the first half of the night. However, sleep is disrupted during the second half. Alcoholics, both during drinking periods and during abstinences, suffer from a multitude of sleep disruptions manifested by profound insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, and altered sleep architecture. Furthermore, subjective and objective indicators of sleep disturbances are predictors of relapse. Finally, within the USA, it is estimated that societal costs of alcohol-related sleep disorders exceeds $18 billion. Thus, although alcohol-associated sleep problems have significant economic and clinical consequences, very little is known about how and where alcohol acts to affect sleep. \n           In this review, we have described our attempts to understand how and where alcohol acts to affect sleep. We have conducted a series of experiments using two different species, rats and mice, as animal models, and a combination of multi-disciplinary experimental methodologies to examine and understand anatomical and cellular substrates mediating the effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure on sleep-wakefulness. \n           The results of our studies suggest that the sleep-promoting effects of alcohol may be mediated via alcohol\u2019s action on the mediators of sleep homeostasis: adenosine (AD) and the wake-promoting cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain (BF). Alcohol, via its action on AD uptake, increases extracellular AD resulting in the inhibition of BF wake-promoting neurons. Lesions of the BF cholinergic neurons or blockade of AD A1 receptors results in attenuation of alcohol-induced sleep promotion, suggesting that AD and BF cholinergic neurons are critical for sleep-promoting effects of alcohol. \n           Since binge alcohol consumption is a highly prevalent pattern of alcohol consumption and disrupts sleep, we examined the effects of binge drinking on sleep-wakefulness. Our results suggest that disrupted sleep homeostasis may be the primary cause of sleep disruption observed following binge drinking. Finally, we have also shown that insomnia and associated sleep disruptions, observed during acute withdrawal, are caused due to impaired sleep homeostasis. \n           Based on our findings, we suggest that alcohol may disrupt sleep homeostasis to cause sleep disruptions.",

There\u2019s been a lot happening in terms of my health and I\u2019m completely overwhelmed, but I\u2019ll try and keep this as short as I can.\n\nFor context/background, approx. 3 months ago I quickly started to develop random symptoms that have left me completely unable to function or live my daily life. Things such as sudden onset of daily migraines, low platelets,  \nvery high resting heart rate, chronic muscle pain, and relentless fatigue to name a few. I\u2019ve had countless tests performed to try and figure out what\u2019s wrong (MRI/CT of head, neck, and chest, bloodwork for autoimmune markers, bone marrow biopsy, lumbar puncture, Covid tests/antibody tests, echocardiogram) all with essentially normal results, aside from a recent diagnosis of sinus tachycardia (which is being treated and helping to lower my heart rate but not providing much relief to anything else). All of these symptoms have been concerning enough, but aren\u2019t pointing to any solid diagnosis. However, that\u2019s not my main concern at this point...\n\nAbout 3 weeks ago I began to have soft tinnitus in one ear, which I didn\u2019t think anything of. It slowly grew louder and spread to the other ear, becoming so loud that I\u2019ve lost multiple nights of sleep in a row. Last Monday, as I was watching TV, I noticed the voices began to sound muffled or like a buzzing noise, almost like they were talking through a static radio on low volume. It went away the next day and I tried to ignore it. Since then, it has been becoming progressively worse. It seems to fluctuate pretty drastically. At times I feel like I can hear perfectly well, but sometimes it gets incredibly hard to hear.  During these periods of time, I can\u2019t understand what people are saying on TV (progressively more muffled/static sounding), I can\u2019t hear my SO if we\u2019re out in a loud public place, I can\u2019t tell where sounds are coming from, and sometimes it seems there is even an echo between my two ears. \n\nOf course, when I went to see an ENT, I was hearing fine and the tests returned normal. At first I thought maybe I was just imagining this, but the worse it gets the more I am convinced that something is genuinely wrong. The ENT was not taking me seriously, but I have never had hearing troubles in my life and I KNOW this is not normal. I\u2019m not regularly exposed to loud noise and I haven\u2019t had any sort of head injury. \n\nI\u2019m honestly terrified. At the rate this is progressing I am afraid I will lose a significant amount of my hearing before a doctor takes me seriously. I have no idea what to do or who to turn to at this point and I am desperate for any advice on a next step to take.  \n\nIs this something I should actually be concerned about? Am I overreacting? If not, how can I get doctors to take me seriously? \n\nI would sincerely appreciate any and all input!

Emerging evidence reveals a direct interplay between COVID-19 and dire cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure, heart attack, myocarditis, arrhythmias as well as blood clots, which are accompanied with elevated risk and adverse outcome among infected patients, even sudden death. The proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of myocardial impairment include invasion of SARS-CoV-2 virus via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to cardiovascular cells/tissue, which leads to endothelial inflammation and dysfunction, de-stabilization of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, stent thrombosis, cardiac stress due to diminish oxygen supply and cardiac muscle damage, and myocardial infarction. Several promising therapeutics are under investigation to the overall prognosis of COVID-19 patients with high risk of cardiovascular impairment, nevertheless to date, none have shown proven clinical efficacy.

    "document": "Biological relevance of ZNF224 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication IN NF-kB pathway regulation\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, whose presentation and clinical course are highly variable. Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",

    "document": "Angiosarcoma of the Liver: Imaging of a rare salient entity\nHepatic angiosarcomas are rare mesenchymal tumors with few case series and reports describing their imaging findings in the last two decades. The computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings are variable and may appear like hemangioma at one end of the spectrum and hepatoma at the other end. The use of hepatocyte specific contrast on magnetic resonance imaging may also be insufficient in making a reliable imaging diagnosis. These tumors can easily mimic hypervascular liver cancer, atypical hemangioma or metastases. This case report highlights the imaging features of this entity and also underlines that, this tumor should always be considered as a differential diagnosis for hypervascular tumors in cirrhotic patients. The current imaging paradigms for its diagnosis are also discussed.",
    "response": "> Also is it odd that the ultrasound never saw this small haemangioma?\n\nRoutine abdominal ultrasound is not looking at every cubic cm of the liver to search for lesions - it's more about the size, echotexture, echogenicity, surface smoothness, and biliary caliber of the overall liver. Missing a 12 mm hemangioma is not surprising. \n\n> From the above, it seems that no follow up is needed. Can someone please explain the significance of the above results?\n\nIncidental, clinically insignificant, and without need for follow-up.\n\nI read horror stories of things like angiosarcomas of the liver being missed.\n\nDon't read those stories then. If there's anything at all *atypical* about the appearance of a hemangioma, sure it's prudent to follow it up once to rule out a growing lesion, but this is classic hemangioma. Angiosarcomas - while they can match the enhancement pattern of a hemangioma - are different enough on all of the rest of the sequences that it would trip some alarm bells. The dynamic/postcontrast part of an MRI is just repetition of the same sequence watching what the gadolinium in the bloodpool does. There are also a bunch of other sequences that provide information about the composition of any given tissue/lesion, plus their appearance on other modalities. Here are some of the [differences]( between hemangioma and angiosarcoma."

Less information is available regarding the risk of myocarditis from COVID-19 infection itself. Such data would be helpful in developing a complete risk-benefit analysis for this population. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             A de-identified, limited data set was created from the TriNetX Research Network, aggregating electronic health records from 48 mostly large U.S. Healthcare Organizations (HCOs). Inclusion criteria were a first COVID-19 diagnosis during the April 1, 2020 - March 31, 2021 time period, with an outpatient visit 1 month to 2 years before, and another 6 months to 2 years before that. Analysis was stratified by sex and age (12-17, 12-15, 16-19). Patients were excluded for any prior cardiovascular condition. Primary outcome was an encounter diagnosis of myocarditis within 90 days following the index date. Rates of COVID-19 cases and myocarditis not identified in the system were estimated and the results adjusted accordingly. Wilson score intervals were used for 95% confidence intervals due to the very low probability outcome. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             For the 12-17-year-old male cohort, 6/6,846 (0.09%) patients developed myocarditis overall, with an adjusted rate per million of 450 cases (Wilson score interval 206 - 982). For the 12-15 and 16-19 male age groups, the adjusted rates per million were 601 (257 - 1,406) and 561 (240 - 1,313). \n             For 12-17-year-old females, there were 3 (0.04%) cases of myocarditis of 7,361 patients. The adjusted rate was 213 (73 - 627) per million cases. For the 12-15- and 16-19-year-old female cohorts the adjusted rates per million cases were 235 (64 - 857) and 708 (359 - 1,397). \n             The outcomes occurred either within 5 days (40.0%) or from 19-82 days (60.0%). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Myocarditis (or pericarditis or myopericarditis) from primary COVID19 infection occurred at a rate as high as 450 per million in young males. Young males infected with the virus are up 6 times more likely to develop myocarditis as those who have received the vaccine.",
    "response": "If his symptoms from the first vaccine were ruled not to be myocarditis, the fact that he's had these symptoms doesn't really say anything about his likelihood of developing myocarditis.

    "document": "Systemic Effects of Ingested Lactobacillus Rhamnosus: Inhibition of Mast Cell Membrane Potassium (IKCa) Current and Degranulation\nExposure of the intestine to certain strains lactobacillus can have systemic immune effects that include the attenuation of allergic responses. Despite the central role of mast cells in allergic disease little is known about the effect of lactobacilli on the function of these cells. To address this we assessed changes in rat mast cell activation following oral treatment with a strain of Lactobacillus known to attenuate allergic responses in animal models. Sprague Dawley rats were fed with  L.rhamnosus  JB-1 (1\u00d710 9 ) or vehicle control for 9 days. Mediator release from peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) was determined in response to a range of stimuli. Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) was used to assess mast cell responses in vivo. The Ca 2+  activated K +  channel (KCa3.1) current, identified as critical to mast cell degranulation, was monitored by whole cell patch-clamp.  L.rhamnosus  JB-1 treatment lead to significant inhibition of mast cell mediator release in response to a range of stimuli including IgE mediated activation. Furthermore, the PCA response was significantly reduced in treated rats. Patch-clamp studies revealed that RPMC from treated animals were much less responsive to the KCa3.1 opener, DCEBIO. These studies demonstrate that Ingestion of L.rhamnosus JB-1 leads to mast cell stabilization in rats and identify KCa3.1 as an immunomodulatory target for certain lactobacilli. Thus the systemic effects of certain candidate probiotics may include mast cell stabilization and such actions could contribute to the beneficial effect of these organisms in allergic and other inflammatory disorders.",

Horrible ones that last days.\n\n\\- Over the past few years, my heartbeat has started absolutely POUNDING. I can really feel it, it's so distracting. Often when I'm doing absolutely nothing. I can see my heart rate in my belly and chest. It's aggressive.\n\n\\- Weird episodes that I thought were \"low blood sugar\" but I don't even know anymore. Get them once every couple of months. Out of nowhere, I get soo sooo shaky and cold sweats and nauseous and dizzy and vertigo-y and have to lay down. Lasts about 20-30 ish minutes. Have gotten them since I was a teenager.\n\n\\- When I'm sick, I'm sick for a LONG time. Got the flu at the beginning of this year and it lasted three and a half weeks. I'm still a bit sniffly but soo glad that it's finally over.\n\n\\- I sweat A LOT. And am easily overheated. I like my house below 68 degrees, I can't handle anything higher.\n\n\\- I get out of breath doing simple things. I used to run three miles every day, but now running makes me feel like my lungs are going to pop out of my chest and like I'm drowning in mucus.\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\n\n\\- I also have a lump on my leg underneath my butt that's been there for about five years. Used to be the size of a pinprick, now  is about the size of a dime or nickel. I know, I'm the grossest human being alive. A few GPs have looked at it at various stages and say it's just a sebaceous cyst and to leave it alone unless it gives me trouble. It's gotten big and uncomfortable enough that I'm going to remove it, tho.\n\n**Some additional info:**\n\n\\- All of my test results have come back normal. Been tested for thyroid stuff and autoimmune, had a CBC (?) panel, nothing out of the usual. I can find the actual test results if anyone would like to look closer.\n\n\\- I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety, as well as ADHD. I take Effexor XR for that and Adderall XR. Honestly? I have no idea what's what any more, because everything feels so intermingled. Probably have ADHD tho because Adderall doesn't really affect me, besides a slight increase in productivity over a period of time.\n\n\\----\n\nPlease, if anyone can help me. I am at the end of my rope. My body feels like it's falling apart and I don't know what to do anymore. I had to leave my job last year because physically going to the office everyday was too much for me. I get out of breath doing simple things, like the laundry. I've always been really active so this is so so so frustrating and my weight has slowly gone up as I've been unable to do stuff. If anyone may know what this is or what type of doctor I should go to or what to do, I really would appreciate it. I'm so tired of being tired and weak and shaky and rashy and bruising and sweaty and in pain.",
    "document": "Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus downregulates FCER1 and HRH4 expression in human mast cells\nAIM: To investigate the effects of four probiotic bacteria and their combination on human mast cell gene expression using microarray analysis. \n           METHODS: Human peripheral-blood-derived mast cells were stimulated with  Lactobacillus rhamnosus  ( L. rhamnosus ) GG (LGG \u00ae ),  L. rhamnosus  Lc705 (Lc705),  Propionibacterium freudenreichii  ssp.  shermanii  JS (PJS) and  Bifidobacterium animalis  ssp.  lactis  Bb12 (Bb12) and their combination for 3 or 24 h, and were subjected to global microarray analysis using an Affymetrix GeneChip \u00ae  Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array. The gene expression differences between unstimulated and bacteria-stimulated samples were further analyzed with GOrilla Gene Enrichment Analysis and Visualization Tool and MeV Multiexperiment Viewer-tool. \n           RESULTS: LGG and Lc705 were observed to suppress genes that encoded allergy-related high-affinity IgE receptor subunits \u03b1 and \u03b3 (FCER1A and FCER1G, respectively) and histamine H4 receptor. LGG, Lc705 and the combination of four probiotics had the strongest effect on the expression of genes involved in mast cell immune system regulation, and on several genes that encoded proteins with a pro-inflammatory impact, such as interleukin (IL)-8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha. Also genes that encoded proteins with anti-inflammatory functions, such as IL-10, were upregulated. \n           CONCLUSION: Certain probiotic bacteria might diminish mast cell allergy-related activation by downregulation of the expression of high-affinity IgE and histamine receptor genes, and by inducing a pro-inflammatory response.",

    "document": "Fecal microbiota transplantation broadening its application beyond intestinal disorders\nIntestinal dysbiosis is now known to be a complication in a myriad of diseases. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as a microbiota-target therapy, is arguably very effective for curing  Clostridium difficile  infection and has good outcomes in other intestinal diseases. New insights have raised an interest in FMT for the management of extra-intestinal disorders associated with gut microbiota. This review shows that it is an exciting time in the burgeoning science of FMT application in previously unexpected areas, including metabolic diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, autoimmune diseases, allergic disorders, and tumors. A randomized controlled trial was conducted on FMT in metabolic syndrome by infusing microbiota from lean donors or from self-collected feces, with the resultant findings showing that the lean donor feces group displayed increased insulin sensitivity, along with increased levels of butyrate-producing intestinal microbiota. Case reports of FMT have also shown favorable outcomes in Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, myoclonus dystonia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. FMT is a promising approach in the manipulation of the intestinal microbiota and has potential applications in a variety of extra-intestinal conditions associated with intestinal dysbiosis.",

    "question": "*EDIT* Thanks for the responses guys, I saw some physicians and on-doctors responded in the comments with a wide range of information. I\u2019m still open to hearing more opinions, but if possible I would like to keep it to doctors only if possible.\n\nAge: 24\nSex: F\nHistory: Asthma, anxiety, signal abnormality in left posterior medial thalamus and in the left posterior midbrain on MRI from July (neurologist said it\u2019s probably not significant but I\u2019ll write it just in case)\nDrugs: never\nAlcohol: socially, but not recently\nSmoking: never\nMedications: none\n\n\nI am at a total loss as I am running out of options. I\u2019ve done a million tests with no diagnosis, the closest thing I\u2019ve been given to alleviate my symptoms is a band-aid solution, and I am losing control of my body. \n\nSince the end of August I have been experiencing a laundry list of odd symptoms including pains in my head that don\u2019t quite feel like headaches, palpitations, constant shortness of breath, chest pains,  spots in my vision, weakness, pain in random parts of my body, and muscle spasms. I went to the ER first for palpitations,  and sudden acute dizziness, and pain on the left side of my neck jaw and my arm. The night before I also had an intense pain in my left temple and felt a popping sensation and then tingling. I assumed it was migraines and forgot about it in the confusion of everything else happening on my way to the ER.\nEKG was normal, chest x-ray was normal, ER doctor suggested a pinched nerve so I got a neck x-ray, which was also normal. My PCP decided to have me tested for Lyme after I developed pains and weakness. The test came up negative. He put me on antibiotics for the time being, guessing it was in the early stages and scheduled a day for me to come back and do another blood test at a later date. I was stable for a while although the pains didn\u2019t seem to let up that much.\n\nSince then I started getting stranger and stranger symptoms. I started to get cold spots in random areas of my body that felt like cold water droplets, and the headaches felt much weirder in a way I can\u2019t properly explain. I just felt vaguely sick in the time between the first and second ER visit.\n\nMy second visit to the ER came after driving home late at night. I had a headache that I think either started in my left temple or a pain that started in my neck. It worked its way to my jaw and before I knew it my lower jaw was shifted to the left side of my face. I could still move it but it took more effort and felt like an elastic band was pulling it there. Once I got home I was having difficulty breathing and according to my mother my body was extremely cold to the touch and when my vitals were taken at triage my blood pressure was low as well.\n\nAt the ER another EKG was done alongside several blood tests and another Lyme test. I was seen by an infectious disease specialist who was on call, had a CT done of my head, was checked for Bell\u2019s palsy and stroke, and had a psychiatrist evaluate me to rule out an anxiety related issue (an idea that had been thrown around a lot amongst the doctors/nurses). All tests came up normal, Bell\u2019s palsy was ruled out, I tested negative for Lyme again, and the psychiatrist stated that while I do struggle with anxiety, it\u2019s not a panic attack and it doesn\u2019t seem to be anxiety related to begin with. I was given Lorazepam during my time there and was prescribed prednisone to take after I got home to see if it would alleviate the spasm.\n\nI made a proper appointment with the infectious disease specialist who didn\u2019t seem to find anything that would be in his field, so he told me to go see my neurologist. The neurologist seemed pretty perplexed at my condition and at some point suggested that a spinal tap might give some answers.\n\nWhile my face got a little better, whatever I had never truly went away and I often felt my tongue rolling either to the back of my mouth or stuck to the left side along with my jaw.\nAs time passed, the sensation of being pulled by an elastic band had travelled to my fingers and my legs. My knees would often buckle or go weak and I was told that I walk like an old lady. I sometimes felt like my body just wanted to move on its own even when it didn\u2019t feel like a spasm. My neck felt stiff almost all the time too.\n\nThe area around the back of my neck and shoulders would often hurt when touched, and I often got winded after walking short distances that I would have been able to walk without issue before getting sick. \n\nI had weird knocking sounds coming from my chest now.\n\n I also had many problems sleeping and would often not be able to get to sleep in the first place because as soon as I got comfortable and tired enough to sleep, I would suddenly stop breathing as if I could not remember how. I had difficulty swallowing and there were times where i was too afraid of choking and would use a straw or a spoon when drinking things. There were many times when I would just jolt up after being only half asleep. Neither my rescue inhaler (proair respiclick) nor my regular inhaler (asthmanex) seemed to do much. \n\nWe decided to hold off on the spinal tap and set up an appointment with a rheumatologist. I didn\u2019t make it to that appointment without my situation worsening yet again.\n\nVisit number 3 to the ER was after a trip to the mall with my mom just two weeks ago. We were deciding where to go eat and my tongue had suddenly shot out of my mouth and I was unable to control it. Within minutes the same thing was happening to my eyes, nose, and lips. It felt similar to when your muscles move involuntarily when you do electric stimulation therapy, except much stronger. I have it on video if it helps, but I don\u2019t want to post my face here so I will message it if someone asks. The sympathetic doctor on duty that day had read all my information and informed me that there isn\u2019t much the ER can do that they haven\u2019t already done and that any other testing bringing me closer to a diagnosis would have to be done through a specialist. He suggested that it might be torticollis and had also asked me if anyone brought up the possibility of Multiple Sclerosis, but that didn\u2019t seem quite right. \n\nI was prescribed lorazepam to use as needed because it helped the spasms a bit.\n\nThe next day my neurologist called to say that he wanted to run some tests because it seemed that he was onto something. We met at the hospital that day and I was admitted for 24 hours to rule out encephalitis among other things.\nI did a spinal tap, an MRI of my brain with and without contrast, a CT scan of my torso with and without contrast, more blood tests, and an EEG overnight. \nThe neurologist came in the next day and from my understanding it\u2019s not likely that I have MS or ALS or anything of that nature. \n\nAs for test results, other than a high  IG count, nothing seemed out of the ordinary with my blood work, the CT scan also found nothing of interest, and the EEG did not show any seizures or anything that raises alarms.\nBecause I am still getting results back at a steady pace from the spinal tap, I don\u2019t know yet if all the results have come in, but so far all of them appear normal except for the CSF Routine Culture, which reads: Value RARE COAGULASE NEGATIVE STAPH POSSIBLE CONTAMINANT\n\nSince them I\u2019ve continued to have the spasms, the odd sensations when trying to sleep, the shortness of breath, the pains, the palpitations and everything else on top of my vision worsening slightly and strange pains in my breasts and underarms. \n\nI visited the rheumatologist a few days ago and he too could not find anything out of the ordinary with my blood work or after examining me. My next stop is the ophthalmologist but I have no idea what they could possibly find and I am running out of doctors to go to and out of tests to do.\n\nMy symptoms are still all there, but at least the spasms have improved slightly. I want to say I\u2019m getting better but I don\u2019t really trust that I am because each time I say that I end up feeling worse at some point in the day. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do anymore. I have been taken to the ER 4 times and have had 5 different specialists see me. I\u2019ve had a million tests done. I would love any sort of advice on what to do next because I am at a total loss and I need help",

    "document": "Advances in Understanding How Heavy Metal Pollution Triggers Gastric Cancer\nWith the development of industrialization and urbanization, heavy metals contamination has become a major environmental problem. Numerous investigations have revealed an association between heavy metal exposure and the incidence and mortality of gastric cancer. The mechanisms of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, chromium, and arsenic) contamination leading to gastric cancer are concluded in this review. There are four main potential mechanisms: (1) Heavy metals disrupt the gastric mucosal barrier by decreasing mucosal thickness, mucus content, and basal acid output, thereby affecting the function of E-cadherin and inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage. (2) Heavy metals directly or indirectly induce ROS generation and cause gastric mucosal and DNA lesions, which subsequently alter gene regulation, signal transduction, and cell growth, ultimately leading to carcinogenesis. Exposure to heavy metals also enhances gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. (3) Heavy metals inhibit DNA damage repair or cause inefficient lesion repair. (4) Heavy metals may induce other gene abnormalities. In addition, heavy metals can induce the expression of proinflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) and microRNAs, which promotes tumorigenesis. The present review is an effort to underline the human health problem caused by heavy metal with recent development in order to garner a broader perspective.",

    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

    "question": "Hi, I\u2019m 38M, white, 145 lbs, 5\u20199\u201d, northeast US. History of vasovagal syncope, unexplained chest aches, asthma, anxiety, GERD, insomnia, bruxism. Duration: varies, up to an hour or more depending on how you count it. Medications are gabapentin and melatonin, both nightly for sleep; actually quit gabapentin seven days ago after a long taper. Got first dose of Pfizer vaccine ten days ago.\n\nI\u2019ve been occasionally getting what I assume are hypoglycemia symptoms: quickly feeling jittery, shaky, a bit sweaty, forceful heartbeat, generally anxious, distracted, and unwell feeling. Usually it resolves 70% pretty quickly if I eat something, though a minor version of the symptoms can linger an hour or more.\n\nI first noticed it two years ago when it happened a few times after long hot showers.\n\nMore recently it\u2019s been happening about once per month, typically right before dinner despite having a substantial snack ~90-120 minutes beforehand. Often I had done minor exercise (such as a long walk) right before hand, but hadn\u2019t done that when it happened tonight. Tonight I\u2019m actually still feeling a bit jittery and slightly blurry vision over an hour later (though mostly better).\n\nOnce 4 years ago I woke up in the middle of the night super shaky and actually went to the ER (not sure if that was the same thing that\u2019s been happening recently) but they didn\u2019t find anything wrong with me.\n\nA few months ago my PCP did a bunch of blood work too and didn\u2019t find anything concerning. \n\nAny ideas what\u2019s going on?

    "document": "The Role of Gastroesophageal Reflux in Provoking High Blood Pressure Episodes in Patients With Hypertension\nGoals: \n             We assessed the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hypertension and whether antiacid therapy could be used to control blood pressure (BP) on hypertension in patients with GERD. \n           \n           \n             Background: \n             Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may provoke cardiovascular disease. Many factors are involved in the development of essential hypertension, but whether GERD has a role needs further study. \n           \n           \n             Study: \n             Patients with essential hypertension (n=86) were studied by 24-hour continuous BP monitoring and esophageal impedance and pH monitoring. Patients fulfilling the GERD criteria received 14-day therapy with omeprazole (20\u2009mg twice a day), and the effect on BP was studied. \n           \n           \n             Results: \n             Of the 86 essential hypertension patients, 38 (44.2%) had GERD. Among these 38 patients, 494 episodes of pathologic reflux (PR), and 684 episodes of high BP were recorded. PR was significantly more common at nighttime especially when supine. Of the 684 episodes of hypertension, 102 (14.9%) were synchronous with PR. GERD patients had significantly higher nocturnal BP than non-GERD patients. Antiacid therapy brought about significant reduction in all esophageal monitoring parameters as well as in BP parameters in GERD patients. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions: \n             This study demonstrated that there is significant correlation between hypertension and GERD.

    "question": "Hi, I'm very worried for my boyfriend (33M) who has been suffering from an unknown condition for over a decade now, and nobody seems to have even heard of it, let alone have any solutions to offer.\n\nNo matter what he eats or drinks at whatever time of day, he has a lot of upper GI gas that he has to force out. Stressful situations seem to be a significant trigger, but it happens even when he's calm. The real problem is at night when he's lying down and it builds up without him able to burp it up. About 45 min to an hour after he falls asleep, the pressure wakes him up in a panic because he can't breathe. He reports feeling very lightheaded and woozy during this time, and it's terrifying for me because he leaps up in the middle of the night sounding like he's having a panic attack: loudly gasping for air and shaking, clawing at his chest to breathe. It's getting worse in both frequency and intensity: now, there is a delay before he can start burping the gas out, and he cannot breathe until he does. The pressure has also started causing him pain in his chest.\n\nHe has seen four different GIs, a nutritionist, two chiropractors, and a couple GPs. He's had a barium swallow, an endoscopy, an acid reflux tube test, all of which showed normal results. He is currently waiting on the results from an immunolabs allergy test and a stool sample test for parasites. He's also getting a motility for GI tract sensitivities this week, but we aren't hopeful, considering every specialist just shrugs their shoulders without a clue.\n\nHas anyone ever heard of this, or have ideas?\n\nMore specific info/history: No current medications, white, height 5'6\", weight 175lb, previously smoked for 1 yr over 9 years ago. He rarely drinks alcohol. These symptoms manifested after he had a diaphragm pull for hiatal hernia in late 2010 to try and deal with massive acid-reflux. He says that's when he started having weird gas build-up in his upper GI. It was after the new symptoms when he got the endoscopy and they didn't find anything and it was labeled as IBS and dismissed (military doctors). It used to happen irregularly, and sometimes infrequently, but now it's almost every night with stronger intensity.\n\nThank you!",
    "document": "Anxiety and depression in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease and their effect on quality of life\nAIM: To explore the role of psychological factors in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and their effect on quality of life (QoL) of GERD patients. \n           METHODS: A total of 279 consecutive patients with typical symptoms and 100 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All of the participants were evaluated with the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (ZSAS), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) and the SF-36 questionnaire. The scores for anxiety, depression and QoL of the two groups were analyzed. The correlation between psychological factors and QoL was also analyzed. \n           RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls (34.70 \u00b1 8.00), the scores of ZSAS in the non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) group (48.27 \u00b1 10.34) and the reflux esophagitis (RE) group (45.38 \u00b1 10.27) were significantly higher ( P <  0.001). The mean ZSAS score of the NERD group was significantly higher than that of the RE group ( P =  0.01). Compared with healthy controls (37.61 \u00b1 8.44), the mean ZSDS scores were significantly higher in the NERD group (49.65 \u00b1 11.09,  P <  0.001) and the RE group (46.76 \u00b1 11.83,  P <  0.001). All dimensions of the SF-36 form were negatively correlated with the SAS and SDS scores in patients with NERD and RE ( P <  0.05). According to the SF-36 form, vitality, mental health and social functioning were significantly correlated with symptoms of depression in patients with NERD and RE. General health was obviously affected by symptoms of depression in patients with NERD ( P <  0.05). \n           CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression may play an important role in the occurrence of GERD and especially that of NERD. The QoL of patients with GERD is reduced by anxiety and depression.",

    "document": "Unexpected Inheritance: Multiple Integrations of Ancient Bornavirus and Ebolavirus/Marburgvirus Sequences in Vertebrate Genomes\nVertebrate genomes contain numerous copies of retroviral sequences, acquired over the course of evolution. Until recently they were thought to be the only type of RNA viruses to be so represented, because integration of a DNA copy of their genome is required for their replication. In this study, an extensive sequence comparison was conducted in which 5,666 viral genes from all known non-retroviral families with single-stranded RNA genomes were matched against the germline genomes of 48 vertebrate species, to determine if such viruses could also contribute to the vertebrate genetic heritage. In 19 of the tested vertebrate species, we discovered as many as 80 high-confidence examples of genomic DNA sequences that appear to be derived, as long ago as 40 million years, from ancestral members of 4 currently circulating virus families with single strand RNA genomes. Surprisingly, almost all of the sequences are related to only two families in the Order  Mononegavirales : the Bornaviruses and the Filoviruses, which cause lethal neurological disease and hemorrhagic fevers, respectively. Based on signature landmarks some, and perhaps all, of the endogenous virus-like DNA sequences appear to be LINE element-facilitated integrations derived from viral mRNAs. The integrations represent genes that encode viral nucleocapsid, RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, matrix and, possibly, glycoproteins. Integrations are generally limited to one or very few copies of a related viral gene per species, suggesting that once the initial germline integration was obtained (or selected), later integrations failed or provided little advantage to the host. The conservation of relatively long open reading frames for several of the endogenous sequences, the virus-like protein regions represented, and a potential correlation between their presence and a species' resistance to the diseases caused by these pathogens, are consistent with the notion that their products provide some important biological advantage to the species. In addition, the viruses could also benefit, as some resistant species (e.g. bats) may serve as natural reservoirs for their persistence and transmission. Given the stringent limitations imposed in this informatics search, the examples described here should be considered a low estimate of the number of such integration events that have persisted over evolutionary time scales. Clearly, the sources of genetic information in vertebrate genomes are much more diverse than previously suspected. \n        \n           Author Summary \n           Vertebrate genomes contain numerous copies of retroviral sequences, acquired over the course of evolution. Until recently they were thought to be the only type of RNA viruses to be so represented. In this comprehensive study, we compared sequences representing all known non-retroviruses containing single stranded RNA genomes, with the genomes of 48 vertebrate species. We discovered that as long ago as 40 million years, almost half of these species acquired sequences related to the genes of certain of these RNA viruses. Surprisingly, almost all of the nearly 80 integrations identified are related to only two viral families, the Ebola/ Marburgviruses, and Bornaviruses, which are deadly pathogens that cause lethal hemorrhagic fevers and neurological disease, respectively. The conservation and expression of some of these endogenous sequences, and a potential correlation between their presence and a species' resistance to the diseases caused by the related viruses, suggest that they may afford an important selective advantage in these vertebrate populations. The related viruses could also benefit, as some resistant species may provide natural reservoirs for their persistence and transmission. This first comprehensive study of its kind demonstrates that the sources of genetic inheritance in vertebrate genomes are considerably more diverse than previously appreciated.",

    "document": "Antigenic Differences between AS03 Adjuvanted Influenza A (H1N1) Pandemic Vaccines: Implications for Pandemrix-Associated Narcolepsy Risk\nBackground \n             Narcolepsy results from immune-mediated destruction of hypocretin secreting neurons in hypothalamus, however the triggers and disease mechanisms are poorly understood. Vaccine-attributable risk of narcolepsy reported so far with the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 vaccination Pandemrix has been manifold compared to the AS03 adjuvanted Arepanrix, which contained differently produced H1N1 viral antigen preparation. Hence, antigenic differences and antibody response to these vaccines were investigated. \n           \n           \n             Methods and Findings \n             Increased circulating IgG-antibody levels to Pandemrix H1N1 antigen were found in 47 children with Pandemrix-associated narcolepsy when compared to 57 healthy children vaccinated with Pandemrix. H1N1 antigen of Arepanrix inhibited poorly these antibodies indicating antigenic difference between Arepanrix and Pandemrix. High-resolution gel electrophoresis quantitation and mass spectrometry identification analyses revealed higher amounts of structurally altered viral nucleoprotein (NP) in Pandemrix. Increased antibody levels to hemagglutinin (HA) and NP, particularly to detergent treated NP, was seen in narcolepsy. Higher levels of antibodies to NP were found in children with DQB1*06\u223602 risk allele and in DQB1*06\u223602 transgenic mice immunized with Pandemrix when compared to controls. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             This work identified 1) higher amounts of structurally altered viral NP in Pandemrix than in Arepanrix, 2) detergent-induced antigenic changes of viral NP, that are recognized by antibodies from children with narcolepsy, and 3) increased antibody response to NP in association of DQB1*06\u223602 risk allele of narcolepsy. These findings provide a link between Pandemrix and narcolepsy. Although detailed mechanisms of Pandemrix in narcolepsy remain elusive, our results move the focus from adjuvant(s) onto the H1N1 viral proteins.",

    "question": "Hello. 25, male, 5'4, 160lbs. I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and gastroparesis. I'm prescribed gabapentin 400mg 3x daily, tramadol 50mg 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours, hydrocodone/acetaminophen 7.5/325mg 1x daily as needed,  fludrocortisone 0.1mg daily, and Tylenol/ibuprofen as needed.\n\nI've had a lot of random, unexplained but serious medical emergencies, such as sudden, spontaneous organ/artery rupture and spontaneous pneumomediastinum that doctors have simply said \"Hm, not sure why that happened, must be the EDS\".\n\nThis past Thursday at approx 2:30am, I was laying in bed just watching TV. Nothing abnormal, and laying in the same position that I always do. Suddenly, I had a severe pain in the back of my neck near the base of my skull, that radiated up over my head all the way my forehead. It felt like my entire head was being crushed. I'm not exaggerating when I say this was 10 out of 10 pain. I've felt severe pain (full knee dislocations, hip dislocations, 10+ abdominal surgeries, 3 orthopedic surgeries, etc) so I have something to compare this to. In the moment, I grabbed my head with my hands, rolled over onto my side and all I could say to my partner was \"something is wrong\". For the next 10-15 minutes, the pain stayed at 10/10. I was extremely dizzy, disoriented, my left arm was tingly, and I couldn't even dress myself to go to the ER. My wife had to put clothes and shoes on me. That's not normal for me.\n\nWe went to the ER, and I was only there for about an hour. By the time I got there, the pain had gone down from 10/10 to 6/10. I took 2 tramadol and a gabapentin 15 minutes before this occured - I think that was a part of why the pain went down.\n\nThe doctor at the ER did a physical exam (touched my neck, asked where it hurt, etc) and said it was a muscle injury. I explained that I've had muscle injuries before, and this feels nothing like that. They brushed me off and sent me home, told me to put heat on it and do neck stretches.\n\nThe next day, I saw my sports medicine doctor. He did an x-ray. It showed a small subluxation in my cervical spine, but he said the x-ray couldn't show much. He ordered an MRI to get a better look at it, but didn't seem concerned.\n\nSince then, that general pain in the area has got worse. It's sitting at 7 out of 10 constantly. I have a severe headache, I'm taking 25mg benadryl, 2 Tylenol, and 2 tramadol every 6 hours just to keep it manageable. Any pressure on the back of my head causes that same severe, sudden shooting pain, the same as the first night. I've had some nausea and vomiting when that happens. Sometimes the pain happens for no reason, without putting pressure on it. As of today, I can't even lay down because the pressure from putting my head down onto the bed/pillow makes the paid shoot up to a 10 instantly. Every time this happens, I can't move, speak, or understand anything anyone is saying to me. It feels like I'm underwater or something - I assume since I'm posting this in a medical subreddit, this won't be so gross, but I've vomited on myself twice now when it happens because I physically can't get up.\n\nIs this just one of those things that feel terrible, but isn't very serious? I've seen two doctors now, who both don't seem very concerned. I'm able to type this post, and 80% of the time the pain is only at a 6 out of 10. In your opinion, am I okay to wait for this MRI, or should I go back to the ER?\n\nI'm already prescribed pain medicine every 4-6 hours for a separate injury, and it helps this pain as well, so I'm not concerned about treating the pain. I can handle a 6/10 pain, especially since I'm currently not working, so I can rest at home. Is there even anything the ER can do if I already had an x-ray?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice. I'll answer any questions, but might be slow. My head is hurting a lot from typing this.",

    "document": "Mechanisms of group A Streptococcus resistance to reactive oxygen species\nStreptococcus pyogenes , also known as group A  Streptococcus  (GAS), is an exclusively human Gram-positive bacterial pathogen ranked among the \u2018top 10\u2019 causes of infection-related deaths worldwide. GAS commonly causes benign and self-limiting epithelial infections (pharyngitis and impetigo), and less frequent severe invasive diseases (bacteremia, toxic shock syndrome and necrotizing fasciitis). Annually, GAS causes 700 million infections, including 1.8 million invasive infections with a mortality rate of 25%. In order to establish an infection, GAS must counteract the oxidative stress conditions generated by the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the infection site by host immune cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. ROS are the highly reactive and toxic byproducts of oxygen metabolism, including hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), superoxide anion (O 2 \u2022 \u2212 ), hydroxyl radicals (OH\u2022) and singlet oxygen (O 2 *), which can damage bacterial nucleic acids, proteins and cell membranes. This review summarizes the enzymatic and regulatory mechanisms utilized by GAS to thwart ROS and survive under conditions of oxidative stress. \n        \n           This review discusses the mechanisms utilized by the bacterial pathogen group A  Streptococcus  to detoxify reactive oxygen species and survive in the human host under conditions of oxidative stress. \n        \n           \n             \n               Graphical Abstract Figure. \n               \n                 This review discusses the mechanisms utilized by the bacterial pathogen group A  Streptococcus  to detoxify reactive oxygen species and survive in the human host under conditions of oxidative stress.",

    "document": "Differential Sensitivity of Lymphocyte Subpopulations to Suppression by Low Density Lipoprotein Inhibitor, an Immunoregulatory Human Serum Low Density Lipoprotein\nReports by a number of investigators have described the thymus-derived (T)-cell dependence of immunoglobulin synthesis by pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulated human peripheral blood bone marrow-derived (B) cells. Because of the cooperative nature of this in vitro system, it was chosen for examination of the differential effects of low density lipoprotein inhibitor (LDL-In) on B- and T-cell functions. Supernates from 7-d cultures that contained either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) or combinations of isolated lymphocyte populations were assayed for immunoglobulin (Ig)G by competitive inhibition radio-immunoassay. LDL-In suppression of whole PBM IgG synthesis occurred at 5-20 \u03bcg protein/ml and was independent of PWM concentration. Maximal suppression required preincubation of cells with LDL-In before stimulation. Suppression was also observed when B cells alone were exposed for 24 h to LDL-In before PWM stimulation; these suppressed B cells were not rescued by normal T cells. Exposure of T cells alone to low doses of LDL-In for 24 h augmented, but high doses suppressed, IgG synthesis, suggesting a differential effect on T-helper vs T-suppressor cell populations. Independent LDL-In exposure of T-helper or T-suppressor cell enriched populations, separated by rosetting with IgG- or IgM-coated ox erythrocytes, identified the T-suppressor cell populations as the most sensitive of the lymphocyte populations tested. The sensitivities of lymphocyte subpopulations to LDL-In, relative to PBM, were 2.8, 1.2, and 0.3 for the T-suppressor cells, B cells and T-helper cells, respectively. Thus, both B and T lymphocytes are sensitive to and can be regulated by LDL-In. In addition, the biologic activity observed when unseparated PBM are exposed to LDL-In appears to represent a composite of the sensitivity of each of the lymphocyte subpopulations.",

    "question": "This feels like the weirdest question I've ever had to ask, but basically the title.\n\n  \nAdditional background: -28 F -5'9\" -150lbs -Caucasian -Former smoker (quit 4 years ago) -Medical conditions: asthma, hypothyroidism, possible spondylitis/arthritic-type condition (seeing a rheum next month), anemia, POTS, ADHD, PTSD, and chronically low vit D. Medicines: -Levothyroxine (100mcg), vit d, b-12, magnesium & calcium supplements, bupropion 100mg slow-release, etodolac 400mg (this is as needed), naproxen sodium 400mg (the day before and the first 2 days of my cycles), and Allegra 60mg (this is during the flares). Known allergies/food intolerances: corn, red peppers & related spices, some dairy, detergents, and Dial soap.\n\n  \nSo basically, for the past 4 of my cycles, I've noticed that I break out in itchy hives on my wrists, lower-mid back, and upper arms about 3-4 days before my cycle starts. A day or two into my cycle, the hives go away. Then the day my period stops, I get a couple more (though not as many/not as bad) before they fade over the next couple days.\n\n  \nI've had a problem over the past two years where I was breaking out in mystery hives and doctors could not figure out why. I went to an allergist and she tested me for a bunch of the most \"common\" allergens: dust, mold, pet dander, soy, milk, oats, gluten, egg, nuts, etc but it all came back clear. We figured out through me documenting what I ate that I was having reactions after I ate things that contained corn/red pepper flakes/paprika. These reactions looked like getting itchy, hives on my sides & back and bad stomach bloating. Since I cut those out, several reactions have died down, but I started noticing the above pattern during my menstrual cycles.\n\n  \nI've been evaluated in the past for PCOS & endo (I got an ultrasound/hormone bloodwork), but PCOS was ruled out and the OBGYN said that she didn't see Endo lesions, but the only way to rule it out would be via surgery, which I have not done since she said that she didn't think it was likely since it didn't show on the ultrasound. So, I don't know if it's related to that or not. (I also want to mention that my thyroid hormone level is in the therapeutic range, got it checked this week).\n\n  \nMy periods are wonky to begin with. They're pretty irregular (last summer, I was getting them every 11 days for a couple months) & heavy (I'll go through a combo of 2-3 tampons and 3-4 pads for the first two-three days), I bloat really badly (like, I look pregnant), and they are often very painful. The pain is why my OBGYN started me on naproxen during my cycle, which does help A LOT. But the hives are terrible, and they come like clockwork.\n\n  \nI'm just wondering if it's possible to be allergic to something having to do with your periods? I don't think it's the tampons/pads, because like I said, it's BEFORE my period starts when they show up, so I'm not using them yet. And I don't use regular detergent/soap, everything is hypoallergenic & fragrance/dye free. So, is it an allergy? Or could it be related to endometriosis? It's just so bizarre to me and when I asked my endocrinologist, she seemed lost.\n\n  \nAnd, what should I do about this? Short of taking Allegra every day of my period.",
    "document": "Sex hormone allergy: clinical aspects, causes and therapeutic strategies \u2013 Update and secondary publication\nSex hormone allergy as a clinical syndrome has been known for almost a century. Due to the diversity of clinical presentation regarding symptoms and disease patterns, the optimal patient care represents an enormous interdisciplinary challenge. Frequently, hypersensitivity reactions affect more than one sex hormone and double positive tests for estrogen and progesterone have been described. Since the menstrual cycle dependent symptoms range from skin afflictions, gynecological problems to non-specific reactions, different pathophysiological mechanisms seem likely. \n           Various desensitization protocols are described as causal treatment options, but are rarely applied in clinical routine. Consequently, major research efforts with a quick translation of therapeutic interventions into clinical practice will be crucial to help affected patients in the future.",
    "response": "You\u2019re right: [\u201cMenstrual cycle dependent urticaria and hypersensitivity reactions to sex hormones were first reported as early as 1921\u201d](\n\nTaking antihistamines is your best bet for now. It\u2019s possible that if you took oral contraceptives and did continuous cycling (ie taking active pills every day instead of having a week of placebo pills where you go through withdrawal bleeding), having more consistent hormone levels would suppress the flares."

    "question": "First off, I'll give my age and gender, but not until the end of this post. I'm constantly getting put into this \"box\" by my doctors whom tell me I'm fine. Like my symptoms literally mean nothing! I want to know what you think a diagnosis may be based solely on my symptoms. \n\nHeight: 5'11\"\nWeight: 150\nRace: white\nDuration of issue: over 3 years\nCurrent meds: pentasa (for crohn's), wellbutrin (anti depressant)\n\nCurrent diagnosed medical issues:\n- Crohn's Disease\n- Interstitial Cystitis\n- Heart condition unknown (reason for post).\n\nSymptoms:\n\nTachycardia - my average Bpm 115-145bpm rarely under 110. Any physical activity and it shoots way up 160 <\n\nPalpitations - Constantly feel thumping in my neck, makes it hard to even sleep. \n\nTwitches - I get random muscle twitches all the time, like a vibration. Typically my knee?? Or abs/stomach? Lasts about 5-10min, happens about every other day. I'll be in bed and my leg will just start vibrating. \n\nTremor - My hands shake HORRIBLY. I work as an orthodontic assistant and have to literally hold one hand with the other hand to even work sometimes... and sometimes it feels like my hand wants to move some random direction out of nowhere, like a big twitch. Hence another reason I use a second hand to stabilize so in case that happens, I won't hurt anyone. My head also has a small tremor that I'll feel, making it bop around very slightly. It's unnoticeable to people unless they're consciously looking for it. \n\nWeakness in hands/grip - When I make a fist I shake so much and have pretty low strength behind it. If I write anything more than a sentence my hands literally hurt. Typing seems to be okay though.\n\nVery very cold hands/feet - My significant other won't even let me touch them sometimes because it literally feels like ice on their skin. The other day I went outside for a few minutes and I literally couldn't feel my fingers. Like, I couldn't feel ANYTHING. Tried to find my phone and I couldn't feel it to pick it up. \n\nNausea - Get random bouts of nausea all the time. Only puke about half the time though, but it makes me miserable. Nausea comes at least every few days. \n\nFatigue - sleep for 10-12 hours most days. Anything less than 8/9 hours I feel like I'm going to faint and have zero energy all day.\n\nDizziness / fainting / vision loss - I get dizzy when getting up from laying/sitting. Often losing my vision completely and I'll have to wait a few seconds before moving. If I bend down to tie my shoes and get back up, feels like I ran a marathon. I'm out of breath, heart races, and get really dizzy. \n\nShortness of breath - I'm constantly feeling like I'm not getting enough air. Even when I'm taking deep breaths. Every time I have to talk to someone, I can't finish a whole sentence without feeling like I need to grasp for air. I have to try so hard to get my sentences to flow smoothly when it feels like I'm suffocating! I'm constantly sighing as well assuming because I'm needing oxygen?\n\nMorning phlegm cough (bloody) - Every single morning I'm hacking up tons of phlegm to the point of not being able to talk sometimes. I'm coughing and coughing all morning. The last few times I've spat it out to see what it looked like and it had a bunch of blood it in. Not sure why? \n\nBrain fog - Feel like I could be staring someone straight in the face having a conversation, but I'll forget everything they just said. I repeat myself a lot because I forget I JUST told someone whatever it was. At work I have to write tons of notes or I'll forget what my boss tells me right after he tells me. It's like my head refuses to hold information. Sometimes in mid sentence I'll forget what we were talking about or I'll feel like I'm drifting really deep in my brain and getting lost. If that makes any sense??? \n\nSlurred Words - Tend to slur my words. Never used to have this problem until all these symptoms started. Like my words come out all mushed together?? Not all the time, but I'll definitely catch myself every day at some point. Sometimes my words are even jumbled in the wrong order or use the wrong words. It's embarrassing..\n\nThat's all the symptoms I can really think of at the moment. I'm desperate for an answer. My doctors say it's just POTS and it's no big deal. But I feel like I'm dying!! Pots has always felt like a cop out diagnosis when they can't figure out what's going wrong. They did an ECG 3 years ago, which apparently came back fine. My doctors still think it's accurate and won't take another... idk how much can change in those years but I feel like I'm definitely worse... idk if those things can miss anything if something is really new? They took it when I first started getting tachycardia episodes. They also did a holter monitor for a day and said my heart was fine. I don't understand how it can be FINE. IT BEATS WAY TOO FAST. Every time I go to the doctor the nurse is shocked at my pulse. Usually 120s. One even said I should go to the ER. (BUT APPARENTLY I'M FINE).\nI've seen three doctors now. First one said it was just POTS and told me to eat 10MG of salt PER DAY. That's crazy right? I tried and just bloated up like a friggin blow fish and nothiming changed. Got a new Dr. Said it's probably POTS and gave me a beta blocker without doing any tests. I asked for a tilt table test at least and he said I didn't need it. Um... isn't that how you diagnose pots?.... then later on when I picked up my medication I did some research before taking it and found it could have a serious drug interaction with another drug I'm taking. Great. Called him up. Said he never knew. Wow. Thanks for almost causing me a serious issue (would have caused extreme low BP). I asked if I could get a new ECG since my other one is so old. He said no.\nGot a new doctor. Said at first that I'm fine and that \"this just happens sometimes\".. um...ok, no. Convinced him to actually get me a treadmill test. But it's been delayed due to weather conditions here. Still waiting to take it. I haven't been able to excersize because I just pass out, so thought it might catch something. \n\nAnyways. I'm at my witts end trying to figure this out.... I refuse to take pots as a diagnosis because it's a SYMPTOM. NOT A CAUSE. Sorry for the caps... Just been angry about this lately.. been trying to get this diagnosed right for 3 years now. I'm really needing to figure out what's going on because I'm trying to get on Remicade for my crohn's, but it's known to cause a fast heart rate! Gastro was worried it'd cause even more problems until we figured out the heart thing. Well years later and I have no real answers still. I'd be ok using a beta blocker, but I want to know what's causing this instead of covering it up???? Please please help me. \n\nMy age is 24 years, I'm a Female. \nI'm tired of being treated like I'm totally fine because I'm not OLD. Younger people can have heart issues too.... any insight would be helpful:(\nIf you have any questions I'll answer!!",
    "document": "Domino effect of hypomagnesemia on the innate immunity of Crohn\u2019s disease patients\nDigestive diseases play major role in development and complications of other disorders including diabetes. For example, Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease associated with Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. The inflammation is a complex process that involves the activity of both innate and adaptive immune responses. CD lesions are primarily due to T cell response, however; innate immune response has a significant role in initiating its pathogenesis. Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors promote the activity of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB pathway for cytokines production. This results in the production of high levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6. Moreover, intestinal inflammation of CD is related to increased activity of NMDA receptors and the release of substance P. Imbalanced magnesium homeostasis in CD is a frequent finding in CD, Diabetes and others. The loss of such a major mineral affects many physiological processes in the body including its role as an immunomodulator. This review aims to (1) describe the significance of hypomagnesemia in the release of pro-inflammatory mediators in CD; (2) demonstrate effects of magnesium on pathways like NF-\u03baB; (3) address the role of hypomagnesemia in the activity of CD; and (4) examine possible future research to establish a standard magnesium supplementation strategy; helping patients with CD or other disorders to maintain a sustained remission.",
    "response": "I understand you're very frustrated by the lack of a clear diagnosis on this one. I can't give you a diagnosis either, but I can give you a doctor's perspective on this.\n\nThe human body does weird things sometimes. It's an incredibly complex collection of trillions of cells with a unique genetic and hormonal environment. When you're working with a system as complex as that, you can't always explain exactly what's going on inside.\n\nWhat doctors do in this situation is look for patterns of malfunctioning which are either common or life-threatening, and give them names. Next we try different treatments for these conditions, and write papers to tell each other what worked and what didn't. Much of the actual biology of what's going on in there remains a mystery - to this day we can't even tell you why general anesthetic knocks you out, or why tylenol reduces your pain.\n\nThis leaves a problem for those people who have symptoms that are neither common nor life-threatening, as their conditions don't get much attention in the research community. POTS is one of these - you're right, it's a syndrome and not a cause, but that's the best we've got at this stage. Irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, conversion disorder and somatic symptom disorder are other examples of syndromes which cause distressing symptoms without a good biological explanation.\n\nSo what do we do in these cases? The first thing to do is to exclude any possible serious causes, which could one day become progressive or life threatening. It sounds like you've had an appropriate workup, including ECG, echocardiogram, and a broad set of blood tests.\n\nOnce we know you're not dying, the next step is to try to reduce the symptoms that are causing you distress. Since there is not a specific name for the constellation of symptoms that you are experiencing, your doctors will just be trying whatever they think might work. \n\nIt's important to note that most of these \"unknown\" disorders are to do with the functioning of the nerves rather than any other part of the body. As well as your muscles, your nerves control your whole gastrointestinal tract, and your heart rate and blood pressure. Given this, anti-depressant medications (which act on nerves) are often effective in treatment of unusual symptoms like yours. Holistic \"mind-body\" therapies like physical activity and cognitive behavioural therapy also often make a big difference, along with the ongoing monitoring and reassurance of a physician you trust.\n\nYou may never get a true diagnosis for your symptoms, but I hope this will help guide your expectations for interactions with your specialists going forward."

Data sets from published and unpublished prospective cohort studies with data on thyroid function tests (thyrotropin [often referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH] and free thyroxine [FT 4 ] concentrations) or thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody measurements and gestational age at birth were screened for eligibility by 2 independent reviewers.

The study population included 47\u2009045 pregnant women (mean age, 29 years; median gestational age at blood sampling, 12.9 weeks), of whom 1234 (3.1%) had subclinical hypothyroidism (increased thyrotropin concentration with normal FT 4  concentration), 904 (2.2%) had isolated hypothyroxinemia (decreased FT 4  concentration with normal thyrotropin concentration), and 3043 (7.5%) were TPO antibody positive; 2357 (5.0%) had a preterm birth. The risk of preterm birth was higher for women with subclinical hypothyroidism than euthyroid women (6.1% vs 5.0%, respectively; absolute risk difference, 1.4% [95% CI, 0%-3.2%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.29 [95% CI, 1.01-1.64]). Among women with isolated hypothyroxinemia, the risk of preterm birth was 7.1% vs 5.0% in euthyroid women (absolute risk difference, 2.3% [95% CI, 0.6%-4.5%]; OR, 1.46 [95% CI, 1.12-1.90]). In continuous analyses, each 1-SD higher maternal thyrotropin concentration was associated with a higher risk of preterm birth (absolute risk difference, 0.2% [95% CI, 0%-0.4%] per 1 SD; OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.00-1.09] per 1 SD).

    "response": "For the most recent measurement, the TSH is just slightly high and the T4 is just slightly low.  This range of labs is sort of controversial.  It's commonly called 'subclinical' hypothyroidism, and many endocrinologists advocate just observing these patients, especially when they're younger.  There isn't a clear consensus on what to do.\n\nTo be honest, when two specialists give two opinions, I usually go with the one who says just to observe things."

    "document": "Thyroid Function Within the Normal Range, Subclinical Hypothyroidism and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation\nBackground \n             Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a highly prevalent disorder leading to heart failure, stroke, and death. Enhanced understanding of modifiable risk factors may yield opportunities for prevention. The risk of AF is increased in subclinical hyperthyroidism, but it is uncertain whether variations in thyroid function within the normal range or subclinical hypothyroidism are also associated with AF. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We conducted a systematic review and obtained individual participant data from prospective cohort studies that measured thyroid function at baseline and assessed incident AF. Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to July 27, 2016. The euthyroid state was defined as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.45\u20134.49mIU/l, and subclinical hypothyroidism as TSH 4.5\u201319.9mIU/l with free thyroxine (fT4) levels within reference range. The association of TSH levels in the euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid range with incident AF was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. In euthyroid participants, we additionally examined the association between fT4 levels and incident AF. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Of 30,085 participants from 11 cohorts (278,955 person-years of follow-up), 1,958 (6.5%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 2,574 individuals (8.6%) developed AF during follow-up. TSH at baseline was not significantly associated with incident AF in euthyroid participants or those with subclinical hypothyroidism. Higher fT4 levels at baseline in euthyroid individuals were associated with increased AF risk in age- and sex-adjusted analyses (hazard ratio=1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.26\u20131.66, for the highest quartile vs the lowest quartile of fT4, p for trend \u22640.001 across quartiles). Estimates did not substantially differ after further adjustment for preexisting cardiovascular disease. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             In euthyroid individuals, higher circulating fT4 levels, but not TSH levels, are associated with increased risk of incident AF.",
    "response": "For the most recent measurement, the TSH is just slightly high and the T4 is just slightly low.  This range of labs is sort of controversial.  It's commonly called 'subclinical' hypothyroidism, and many endocrinologists advocate just observing these patients, especially when they're younger.  There isn't a clear consensus on what to do.\n\nTo be honest, when two specialists give two opinions, I usually go with the one who says just to observe things."

    "question": "If there are any questions on specifics I'm happy to answer this is my first post on this platform.\n\nAge:21 Height:5'7\" Weight:230 Gender:female Duration of complaint: 21 years Race:black Location:Washington\n\nWhen I was born I had something called epispadias (would also love more elaboration on this) but as my ma described it, I was born with my bladder exposed (and maybe some other stuff I'm unsure, she doesn't like talking about it and also didn't look too much when I was born.) Doctors sewn me up and I didn't find out I was born with anything wrong until I was 16 after I went in for a urology test because I've been dealing with incontinence since I could remember (I wear large ass pads, and the only way to really control it is lack of water and fluids.) Apparently I'm 1 in a million or some shit (rare for women, hella rare for African Americans) Doctor gave me three options. 1. Collagen injection into the loose inner sphincter of my urethra 2. They go in and surgically try to fix it 3. A pump and a bag. If done incorrectly he said the first two options could lead to three. And he also said they get these kind of cases (I think he was referring to epispadias, incontinence has gotta be a common thing right?) Every 20 years. Honestly the urology and the new info about myself fucked me up so I just kinda pushed it out of my mind. That's the first part of this post. Anymore information on this would also be appreciated.\n\nAlright so. Few months or so ago, tried to have sex for the first time with a good friend. I had my suspicions about my vagina not being fully capable but was unsure and thought a test run was in order. We tried on three separate occasions but all three times left us with zero success and sexual frustrations. He said everything was really close together (referring to my vaginal opening and anus) and there was zero give. We've thought and tried forcing it, but to no avail. Yes, I was aroused enough, yes, we used lube. I just. Don't know what to do. I feel like half a person, and sexually frustrated out of my goddamn mind, yes I'd like my bladder to also work, but hell, I'd also like to enjoy a goddamn dick. anyone know of anymore information or specialists on these issues?\n\nEdit: hey y'all so I will look through the free clinics, I've been trying to figure out what to do because of a recent job change since I won't have my old workplaces' insurance, I've felt around down there before. Can barely fit a pinky also recently felt around again and it seems as though I have to small openings on either side where the entrance should be. I do have periods. I've also tried the incontince panties they help with the inevitable chaffing of these huge pads but with a hydrated me they usually aren't enough. Thank you for all the responses \ud83d\ude2d I haven't been able to find out a whole lot of info and it's been difficult to bring up and talk about. I also went on a search for the doctor that did the operation when I was born (he was my doc growing up for most of my youth but I had no idea what most the test and things were since I was so young, and I don't remember alot) I would honestly love to talk to him directly but he retired.

No blockages in the *large* blood vessels (which is good). But the small blood vessels are responsible for those T2 changes, as above.  \n\n* No area of destruction... diffusion...: This means no stroke going on *right this moment*.

The \"classic\" MRI of Alzheimer's shows volume reduction in specific parts of the brain (not diffuse) but this is honestly pretty tricky. \"Diffuse\" does not automatically mean \"it's vascular dementia and not Alzheimer's.\" Personally I don't like the phrasing \"usual for age group.\" Radiologists in the USA use it too. It may be \"usual\" to have an abnormal MRI, abnormal stress test of the heart, knee arthritis, glaucoma, etc. when you approach 80 years old, but too often this phrasing gets *misinterpreted* (by doctors, patients, and families alike) as \"completely normal MRI which does not explain the patient's symptoms.\"   \n\n* Focuses of signal hyperintensity...: They are just summarizing and restating what they said above.  \n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI mostly focused on interpreting the MRI report, because that was the biggest part of your post. Obviously there's more to it (see caveats below). I'm sorry to hear that you father is having these memory problems.  \n\n\nClassically, Alzheimer's dementia is a slow, steady loss of memory. But vascular dementia happens in sudden (but small) steps. Such as \"I noticed in the middle of February that she kept asking the same question again. Then she stayed the same, but in November she started to forget what day it was.\" A lot of times, information from the family is *more important* than the MRI test in making the diagnosis. Your father is lucky to have you around helping him through this.  \n\n\n# Caveats\n\nI don't know 100% what you mean by \"most of the exams.\" Probably you mean scans and lab tests, but I don't know if your father had neurocognitive testing (this is a process where you spend a long time with an examiner who asks memory questions, drawing tasks, planning tasks, etc.). I would be surprised if neurocognitive testing was normal given what you said.  \n\n\nI also don't know exactly what you mean by \"confusion.\" To doctors, there are ways to distinguish disorientation (like not knowing what day it is) from delirium (can be disoriented but also very much comes and goes, and involves problems with very short term attention tasks).   \n\n\nI'm not a radiologist or neurologist. Biases: the 2 most common causes of dementia in my patients (adults in the USA) are Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. A big percentage of my patients have MRI reports that sound exactly like your father's.  \n\n\nLastly, please let me know if any of my English is too technical or has too much jargon, and I can try to reword it."

    "document": "Physical Exercise as a Preventive or Disease-Modifying Treatment of Dementia and Brain Aging\nA rapidly growing literature strongly suggests that exercise, specifically aerobic exercise, may attenuate cognitive impairment and reduce dementia risk. We used PubMed (keywords  exercise  and  cognition ) and manuscript bibliographies to examine the published evidence of a cognitive neuroprotective effect of exercise. Meta-analyses of prospective studies documented a significantly reduced risk of dementia associated with midlife exercise; similarly, midlife exercise significantly reduced later risks of mild cognitive impairment in several studies. Among patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) documented better cognitive scores after 6 to 12 months of exercise compared with sedentary controls. Meta-analyses of RCTs of aerobic exercise in healthy adults were also associated with significantly improved cognitive scores. One year of aerobic exercise in a large RCT of seniors was associated with significantly larger hippocampal volumes and better spatial memory; other RCTs in seniors documented attenuation of age-related gray matter volume loss with aerobic exercise. Cross-sectional studies similarly reported significantly larger hippocampal or gray matter volumes among physically fit seniors compared with unfit seniors. Brain cognitive networks studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging display improved connectivity after 6 to 12 months of exercise. Animal studies indicate that exercise facilitates neuroplasticity via a variety of biomechanisms, with improved learning outcomes. Induction of brain neurotrophic factors by exercise has been confirmed in multiple animal studies, with indirect evidence for this process in humans. Besides a brain neuroprotective effect, physical exercise may also attenuate cognitive decline via mitigation of cerebrovascular risk, including the contribution of small vessel disease to dementia. Exercise should not be overlooked as an important therapeutic strategy.",

    "document": "Biological relevance of ZNF224 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication IN NF-kB pathway regulation\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, whose presentation and clinical course are highly variable. Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",
    "response": "TLDR: there are changes in the brain from long term blood vessel problems. This is not \"normal\" *per se* but is unfortunately very common, and these changes can in turn cause what is called **vascular dementia.** I think that this scan as written does not particularly rule in or rule out **Alzheimer's dementia** (it is also possible to have two causes of dementia). Either way, it still sounds like dementia.  \n\n\nNeurologist is exactly the person to go see. Questions I would ask him/her: What is the cause of the memory loss and confusion? What should we do about it? They might say \"I don't know the cause for sure,\" which is true, but it's OK to press them a little for an educated guess.  \n\n\n# In detail\n\n* Spotlights of signal superintensity...: Changes from blood vessel problems (like hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol). Some people might call these \"mini strokes\" but that term is used pretty loosely. When you see these spots on the MRI scan, the person may not have had any obvious stroke symptoms in the past (slurred speech, weakness, face drooping). These spots probably happened one or two at a time, over the course of years. Looks basically like [this picture.](  \n\n* no evidence of an intraparenchymatous...: No sign of a cancer, no emergency situation with bleeding or fluid blockages (not surprising).  \n\n* Usual flow...: This means they did a magnetic resonance *angiogram* in addition to the \"regular\" MRI. No blockages in the *large* blood vessels (which is good). But the small blood vessels are responsible for those T2 changes, as above.  \n\n* No area of destruction... diffusion...: This means no stroke going on *right this moment*. Also good.  \n\n* Signs of diffuse...: There is slightly less brain material there than there once was, and it seems to be affected all over (not in one particular place).

    "document": "Frequency of twinning in southwest Nigeria\nBACKGROUND: \n             In the human species, twin is a type of multiple birth in which the mother gives birth to two offspring from the same pregnancy. The occurrence and frequency of twinning, however, varies across human populations. The maternal age, socio-environmental factors, increase in the use of contraceptives, the race of human population, increase in the spontaneous abortion rate, and seasonal variations are among the factors that could influence twinning rate. Information on twinning rates in southwest Nigeria is limited. \n           \n           \n             AIMS: \n             This study presents information on the frequency of twinning, as well as its analysis by maternal age, in four urban settings in southwest Nigeria. This is with the aim of extending current knowledge on the frequency of twinning in southwest Nigeria and contributing to the demographic studies in the country. \n           \n           \n             MATERIALS AND METHODS: \n             Data on single births and twin births from January 1995 to December 2004 were collected from the Oyo State General Hospital (OSGH), Wesley Guild Hospital (WGH), Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital (OAUTH), and Ekiti State Specialist Hospital (ESSH) in Ogbomoso, Ilesa, Ile-Ife, and Ado-Ekiti respectively. These were analyzed by year and maternal age groups of 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, and 45-49 years according to the standard method. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS: \n             A frequency of twin births of 46.5 per 1000 deliveries and 46.2 per 1000 deliveries was recorded for Ilesa and Ile-Ife respectively. The frequency recorded for Ogbomoso and Ado-Ekiti was 38.5 and 22.1 per 1000 deliveries respectively. The overall average frequency of 40.2 per 1000 deliveries for the four hospitals ranks among the highest recorded rates of twin births in the world. The maternal age group of 25-29 years had the highest occurrence of twin births, while the lowest was recorded in the 45-49 years age group. \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSION: \n             This analysis reveals high incidence of twinning in the studied areas and supports previous assertion that the southwestern part of Nigeria has the highest twinning rate in the country and in the whole world. It is our opinion that diet, maternal history of twinning, and some socio-environmental factors may have influenced the results.",

    "question": "I am on day 42 of the worst headache I\u2019ve had, starts in the base of my skull where the neck and skull meet, with more of the pain on the left side and it radiates up to behind my left eye. Can sometimes be a pinching feeling behind eye and above left eyebrow and into my left upper jawbone. The feeling is stabbing sometimes, like a knife in my left eyebone. The headache has never gone away, it\u2019s 24/7. I had a brain MRI, so I don\u2019t have any masses, aneurysms or anything. I see a neurologist but I\u2019ve been to the ER 3 times for this, my PCP 4 times. The pain has gotten better since it started but it\u2019s still there. Of course I have googled because I\u2019m day 42 of this awful headache and my doctor or ER doctors can\u2019t tell me why I feel like I don\u2019t want to wake up anymore. I think this may be occipital neuralgia. The headache is worse upon moving my head, even laying on a pillow I can\u2019t get comfortable. Triptans don\u2019t help, the only thing that helped was a Percocet and that lasted 2 hours. \nCan occipital neuralgia be constant? Everything I\u2019ve seen online says the pain can last minutes or hours but if there\u2019s a constant compressed nerve, can\u2019t it last days/months? The stabbing pain isn\u2019t always there, but the headache is. I had lymph node excision on my neck on the left side and I\u2019m wondering if they turned my neck wrong when doing surgery. I believe the surgeon said the lymph node was wrapped around a nerve? But the surgery went great and all was well according to the ENT but I was never the same after waking up. I\u2019ve had a headache since I woke up. \n\nSo i couldn\u2019t find it online but is the vagus nerve near the occipital nerve? Since I\u2019ve had this possible occipital neuralgia (I am 99.9% this is what it is), my BP has been through the roof. I even take diltiazem for coronary vasospasms and it\u2019s like 120/95 or 130/85 (this is through the roof for me). I have always had chronically low BP (90/60) and even take midodrine to raise my BP but since my surgery I haven\u2019t had to take it because my BP has been high and my POTS symptoms have been kind of flared up. Mostly my HR and my BP. Is it possible if the occipital nerve is being affected by being compressed from a bad spine, arthritis (I have a bad spine), is it possible that the vagus nerve could be compressed from 1. Fibromyalgia (which I have), the tightness of the muscles in the upper back 2. My cervical spine maybe misaligned 3. My ENT surgeon touched on a nerve while getting the two lymph nodes during a lymph node excision and it aggravated my nerves? I\u2019m truly at a loss. Last night was the worst behind the eye pain I\u2019ve ever had. I wanted to die.

This may result in enhanced transmission of mutant malaria parasites, as previously shown for chloroquine resistant parasites. In the present study, we determine the association between parasite mutations, submicroscopic  P. falciparum  gametocytemia and malaria transmission to mosquitoes. \n           \n           \n             Methodology/Principal Findings \n             Samples from children treated with SP alone or in combination with artesunate (AS) or amodiaquine were genotyped for SNPs in the  dhfr  and  dhps  genes. Gametocytemia was determined by microscopy and  Pfs25  RNA\u2013based quantitative nucleic acid sequence\u2013based amplification ( Pfs25  QT-NASBA). Transmission was determined by membrane-feeding assays. We observed no wild type infections, 66.5% (127/191) of the infections expressed mutations at all three  dhfr  codons prior to treatment. The presence of all three mutations was not related to higher  Pfs25  QT-NASBA gametocyte prevalence or density during follow-up, compared to double mutant infections. The proportion of infected mosquitoes or oocyst burden was also not related to the number of mutations. Addition of AS to SP reduced gametocytemia and malaria transmission during follow-up. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions/Significance \n             In our study population where all infections had at least a double mutation in the  dhfr  gene, additional mutations were not related to increased submicroscopic gametocytemia or enhanced malaria transmission. The absence of wild-type infections is likely to have reduced our power to detect differences.

Because of the predilection of mitochondrial disorders to involve the optic nerves, extraocular muscles, retina, and even the retrochiasmal visual pathways, the ophthalmologist is often the first physician to be consulted. Disorders caused by mitochondrial dysfunction can result from abnormalities in either the mitochondrial DNA or in nuclear genes which encode mitochondrial proteins. Inheritance of these mutations will follow patterns specific to their somatic or mitochondrial genetics. Genotype-phenotype correlations are inconstant, and considerable overlap may occur among these syndromes. The diagnostic approach to the patient with suspected mitochondrial disease entails a detailed personal and family history, careful ophthalmic, neurologic, and systemic examination, directed investigations, and attention to potentially life-threatening sequelae. Although curative treatments for mitochondrial disorders are currently lacking, exciting research advances are being made, particularly in the area of gene therapy. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, with its window of opportunity for timely intervention and its accessibility to directed therapy, offers a unique model to study future therapeutic interventions.

Papers addressing pyridoxine plus doxylamine (Bendectin in the United States, Debendox in the United Kingdom, Diclectin in Canada, Lenotan and Merbental in other countries) prior to the year 2001 were excluded  post-hoc  because of several previously published meta-analyses and commentaries on this medication. \n           \n           \n             Expert opinion \n             The literature on the safety of antihistamine use during pregnancy with respect to birth defects is generally reassuring though the positive findings from a few large studies warrant corroboration in other populations.

    "question": "I'm an 18 year old man who went through 2 operations on undecended testicles, about a year apart when I was 11-14 (I've actually forgot and don't want to ask my parents).\n\nA little backstory - I first went to A&E (British emergency room) after experiencing intense chronic pain in my lower abdomen/ upper crotch along with a fairly sizable lump where the pain was. I couldn't walk for a few days or stretch my lower half. And after an ultrasound and physical exam by a nurse it was concluded that neither of my testicles had decended at birth and were stuck just above my hips (where the pain was) shortly after their realisation that massaging them wouldn't move them was put on pain killers and scheduled for an operation to manually put the left one in my scrotum where it's supposed to be. This included the assumption that after a few months the right hand one (that diddnt hurt so much) would move on it's own would descend within the year - it of course, diddnt - so I was back a year later for the same operation on the right side. After that the pain was gone and I had both of my testies in my scrotum where they belong.\n\nAs of recent I've had some questions about my future and how this would effect my fertility and sex life. I've noticed that it's very difficult for me to finish during sex or masturbation (I don't masturbate much anyway due to a low libido - also related?). I'm not too keen about asking my parents or doctor just yet as they'll get concerned that I want to conceive at 18 (I don't!) However I will most likely ask some time in the future. Should I?\n\nTL;DR: After 2 operations on undecended testicles during early adolescence should I be concerned about future fertility / libido etc.",
    "document": "Cryptorchidism and Fertility\nCryptorchidism, the failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum prenatally, occurs in 2.4%\u20135% of newborns. Many of these testes will descend spontaneously shortly after birth, but ~23% will remain undescended unless surgery is performed. Bilaterally cryptorchid men have a six times greater risk of being infertile when compared with unilaterally cryptorchid men and the general male population. Approximately 10% of infertile men have a history of cryptorchidism and orchidopexy. The main reasons for infertility in men with a history of cryptorchidism treated by orchidopexy are maldevelopment of the testes and an improper environment for the normal development of the testes, hyperthermia, and antisperm antibodies.",
    "response": "It's strongly correlated with infertility, especially if it's bilateral rather than unilateral. \n\n> A study was carried out on a sample of unilateral and bilateral cases of cryptorchidism with a control group and concluded that paternity was significantly compromised in men with previous bilateral, but not unilateral, cryptorchidism. .... Infertility is more noticed in cases of bilateral undescended testis, with subfertility logically to be with unilateral. This may be explained in the light of evidence that bilateral cryptorchidism causes a significant decrease in spermatogenesis in comparison with unilateral cryptorchidism. .... In cases of bilateral undescended testis, ~50% of patients show decreased sperm densities. Follow-up of a sample of unilateral and bilateral cases revealed that unilateral cases showed normal rates of paternity and normal concentration of sperms versus only two out of 15 bilateral cryptorchidism cases who finally succeed to have children.\n\n*[Fawzy F, Hussein A, Eid MM, El Kashash AM, Salem HK.

    "question": "Hi everyone! I am a 24F from Mumbai, India. I have a strange disease that's been bothering me a bit. During the last week of November, I saw a red worm pop out while I was pooping. I went to a gastroenterologist and he advised me to take Zentel, assuming it to be another usual worm. I kept seeing the alive worm (5-6 times a week) even though I completed the course. Next, I visited a urologist, and he again gave me Zentel but asked me to catch a worm for diagnosis. Between all this, the frequency of worms increased to be 3-4 everyday. I caught the worm and it turned out to be shistosomiasis. He prescribed me the medication (Praziquantel) which had to be taken the same day (the usual dose) and after 3 more weeks. Before taking Praziquantel, I went for a second diagnosis after catching another worm and the microbiologist said it's urogential myasis or fly larve. After taking Praziquantel, I saw the worm twice. Alive. Took the final dose after 3 weeks yesterday. I should not see the worm after this, if it's shistosoma.\n\n\nI traveled to Bali in March/April and stayed in a villa that had a huge washroom and open area with a few snails. But I'm not sure if the snail spieces in Bali supports urinary shistosomiasis. As per the research papers on the internet, it doesn't. My urine routine have never revealed any eggs. I also traveled to Goa in September.\n\n\nWhat the fuck is happening? Am I imagining this or this for real?! \nAlso, the doctors of India are not much informed about parasitic infections. So that's a problem too.\n\nI do not have any symptoms except frequent UTIs and freuqent urination. Shall get sonography reports tomorrow. Will update the results. \n\nVideo link: \n\n\n\nI am currently reaching out to more doctors in Mumbai as well. It's just the disease is so rare that it took me a few days to get medicine in Mumbai. It was out of stock! Just looking at reddit to see if some doctor can advise me something the local doctors might be missing. \n\nTLDR; See red worms in pee, not clear whether shistosoma or Urogential myasis or something else.

The health effects of smoking only a few CPD over one\u2019s lifetime are less understood than are the effects of heavier smoking, although many smokers believe that their level is modest. \n           \n           \n             OBJECTIVE \n             To evaluate the associations of long-term smoking of fewer than 1 or 1 to 10 CPD (low intensity) with all-cause and cause-specific mortality compared with never smoking cigarettes. \n           \n           \n             DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS \n             Prospective cohort study of 290 215 adults in the National Institutes of Health\u2013AARP (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study who were aged 59 to 82 years in calendar years 2004\u20132005 (baseline). Data were gathered with a questionnaire assessing lifetime cigarette smoking history. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were determined for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality through the end of 2011. Hazard ratios and 95% CIs were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models using age as the underlying time metric and adjusted for sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, physical activity, and alcohol intake. Data analysis was conducted from December 15, 2015, to September 30, 2016. \n           \n           \n             EXPOSURES \n             Current and historical smoking intensity during 9 previous age periods (from <15 years to \u226570 years) over the lifetime assessed on the 2004\u20132005 questionnaire. \n           \n           \n             MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES \n             All-cause and cause-specific mortality among current, former, and never smokers. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS \n             Of the 290 215 cohort participants who completed the 2004\u20132005 questionnaire, 168 140 were men (57.9%); the mean (SD) age was 71 (5.3) years (range, 59\u201382 years). Most people who smoked fewer than 1 or 1 to 10 CPD at baseline reported smoking substantially higher numbers of CPD earlier in their lives. Nevertheless, 159 (9.1%) and 1493 (22.5%) of these individuals reported consistently smoking fewer than 1 or 1 to 10 CPD in each age period that they smoked, respectively. Relative to never smokers, consistent smokers of fewer than 1 CPD (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.07\u20132.51) and 1 to 10 CPD (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.64\u20132.13) had a higher all-cause mortality risk. Associations were similar in women and men for all-cause mortality and were observed across a range of smoking-related causes of death, with an especially strong association with lung cancer (HR, 9.12; 95% CI, 2.92\u201328.47, and HR, 11.61; 95% CI, 8.25\u201316.35 for <1 and 1\u201310 CPD, respectively). Former smokers who had consistently smoked fewer than 1 or 1 to 10 CPD had progressively lower risks with younger age at cessation. For example, the HRs for consistent smokers of fewer than 1 and 1 to 10 CPD who quit at 50 years or older were 1.44 (95% CI, 1.12\u20131.85) and 1.42 (95% CI, 1.27\u20131.59), respectively. \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE \n             This study provides evidence that individuals who smoke fewer than 1 or 1 to 10 CPD over their lifetime have higher mortality risks than never smokers and would benefit from cessation. These results provide further evidence that there is no risk-free level of exposure to tobacco smoke.",

    "document": "Karoshi May Be a Consequence of Overwork-Related Malignant Arrhythmia\nBackground \n             Karoshi, which is sudden death associated with overwork, has become a serious problem in China. Many studies have examined the relationship between cardiovascular risks and karoshi, but there is little evidence that explains the exact mechanism by which overwork induces sudden death. In these cases, there are few obvious positive findings from forensic autopsies except for histories of overwork prior to death. Therefore, we assume that abnormalities, such as cardiac arrhythmia, rather than organic changes are the cause of karoshi. \n           \n           \n             Material/Methods \n             In the present study, the forced swim test (FST) was used to establish models of overwork. The myocardial tissues of SD rats taking FST (1 h per day, for 30 consecutive days) were collected. The arrhythmia-related molecule CX43 as well as its upstream regulation molecule Cav-1 and cSrc were tested by Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).

    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations.

The growing trend in data disclosure has created more potential sources for the input for predictive models, posing new challenges to the prediction of traffic flow in the era of big data. In this study, the prediction of urban traffic flow was regarded as a spatiotemporal prediction problem, focusing on the traffic speed. A Graph LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Spatiotemporal Neural Network (GLSNN) model was constructed to perform a multi-scale spatiotemporal fusion prediction based on the multi-source input data. The GLSNN model consists of three parts: MS-LSTM, LZ-GCN, and LSTM-GRU. We used the MS-LSTM module to scale the traffic timing data, and then used the LZ-GCN network and the LSTM-GRU network to capture both the time and space dependencies. The model was tested on a real traffic dataset, and the experiment results verified the superior performance of the GLSNN model on both a high-precision and multi-scale prediction of urban traffic flow.",

    "document": "Radiation Dose Associated with Common Computed Tomography Examinations and the Associated Lifetime Attributable Risk of Cancer\nBackground \n             Use of computed tomography (CT) for diagnostic evaluation has increased dramatically over the past two decades. Even though CT is associated with substantially higher radiation exposure than conventional x-rays, typical clinical doses are not known. We sought to estimate the radiation dose associated with common CT studies in clinical practice; assess variation in dose across types of studies, patients, and institutions; and quantify the potential cancer risk associated with these examinations. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Retrospective cross-sectional study describing radiation dose associated with the 11 most common types of diagnostic CT studies performed on 1,119 consecutive adult patients at four San Francisco Bay Area institutions between January 1 and May 30, 2008. We estimated lifetime attributable risks of cancer by study type from these measured doses. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Radiation doses varied significantly between the different types of CT studies. The overall median effective doses ranged from 2.1 milli-Sieverts (mSv) for a routine head CT (interquartile range [IQR] 1.8\u20132.8) to 31 mSv (IQR 21\u201343) for a multiphase abdomen and pelvis CT. Within each type of CT study, effective dose varied significantly within and across institutions, with a mean 13-fold variation between the highest and lowest dose for each study type. The estimated number of CTs that will lead to the development of a cancer varied widely depending on the specific type of CT examination and the patient\u2019s age and sex. An estimated 1 in 270 women who underwent a coronary angiography CT at age 40 will develop cancer from that CT (1 in 600 men), compared with an estimated 1 in 8,100 women who had routine head CT at the same age (1 in 11, 080 men). For 20-year olds the risks were approximately doubled, and for 60-year olds, the risks were approximately 50% lower. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Radiation doses from commonly performed diagnostic CT examinations were higher and more variable than generally quoted, highlighting the need for greater standardization across institutions. For individuals, and especially younger female patients, the benefits of CT imaging must be balanced against the potential harm from its associated radiation.",
    "response": "The numbers you might find can vary in part because how much radiation exposure you get through imaging can vary. A chest X-ray is somewhere around 0.1 milliSievert (mSv). An abdominal CT is somewhere around 10-20 mSv, so yes, it's probably closer to the 100-200 X-ray range. Contrast isn't itself radioactive, but if you have a CT done with and without contrast you double your radiation exposure, and the protocols for contrast generally involve a little bit more exposure, I believe.\n\nWhat's your risk? Low but not zero.

    "question": "Edit: thank you all so much for your incredibly insightful responses!! We\u2019re going to take this time and search out pain management, alternative treatments and lifestyle changes we can in implement in hopes that he might not need as much of the medication he does now. I hadn\u2019t realized just how serious long term use of oxy may be and the fact he is most likely dependent upon it now is  concerning & unhealthy to say the least. I was frightened because one of the receptionist I spoke with said although they can\u2019t help he needs it because at times withdrawal from it can lead to death. Thank you all again.\n\nHello all, I need some help figuring out how to help my father. He is 66 years old, has a slew of health issues And a cabinet full of medicine to take daily unfortunately. Some years ago he was prescribed oxycodone for the multiple times he\u2019s gotten hit by cars. Nearly a month ago, the doctor he was seeing had has license revoked due to a patient dying under his care from prescribing a medication he should not have. Ever since then my dad has not been able to find a new doctor willing to prescribe his pain medication due to being \u201cscared\u201d of what happened with his previous doctor. It does not help that we are not able to locate the previous doctor and obtain his medical records as is. This whole situation has been awful. My dad had been on this medication before he moved to this area nearly 2 years ago and started seeing this doctor. His jaw, femur, several fingers have been broken. He\u2019s been shot, stabbed, fell down and busted his head and eye in his elderly age. He\u2019s been burned. That\u2019s just externally. He still has a slew of problems internally. From problems with his liver to diabetes. He is a very sick man and it saddens me but I am just thankful for him to wake up everyday but His pain is real. He truly needs his medication. One of the doctors that refused to see and treat him recommended that he go to the hospital and tell them about the situation and they would prescribe his pain medication. Is this true? Or should we begin to find alternatives even though I\u2019m not sure where to start with that? Any kind of guidance would be so helpful as I am completely lost on how to help him. His legs are weak and since he is at risk I don\u2019t want to risk him going into the hospital for no good reason. Thank you all in advance.",

Occasionally, the consultation fails to provide desired clarity in making labeling an individual as having fibromyalgia (FM), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A chemokine and cytokine multiplex assay was developed and tested with the goal of improving and achieving an accurate differential diagnosis. 160 patients with FM, 98 with RA and 100 with SLE fulfilling accepted criteria were recruited and compared to 119 controls. Supernatant cytokine concentrations for IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta were determined using the Luminex multiplex immunoassay bead array technology after mitogenic stimulation of cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Each patient\u2019s profile was scored using a logistical regression model to achieve statistically determined weighting for each chemokine and cytokine. Among the 477 patients evaluated, the mean scores for FM (1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2; 1.52\u20131.89), controls (\u22123.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7; \u22124.59 to \u22122.54), RA (\u22120.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.26; \u22121.12 to \u22120.23) and SLE (\u22121.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.34, \u22122.1 to \u22120.79). Ninety-three percent with FM scored positive compared to only 11\u00a0% of healthy controls, 69\u00a0% RA or 71\u00a0% SLE patients had negative scores. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive value for having FM compared to controls was 93, 89, 92 and 91\u00a0%, respectively ( p \u00a0<\u00a02.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u221216 ). Evaluating cytokine and chemokine profiles in stimulated cells reveals patterns that are uniquely present in patients with FM.

    "response": "In most states, long term opiate prescriptions are managed specifically by pain management physicians (unless it\u2019s a terminal cancer or sickle cell patient). I would find a new PCP (family/IM/geriatric medicine) and ask for a referral to pain management. Most family docs would be comfortable providing a short course of opiates if clinically indicated to get him by until he sees the pain doc. Also all states (as far as I know) have a statewide reporting data base for narcotics so they should be able to look him up on it and see all of his past prescriptions to confirm what he was getting. If he is miserable and writhing in pain, the ER is an option but limited on what they can do (and prescribing opiates from the ER is very provider dependent)."

This organism has never been maintained in axenic culture, and there has remained some doubt as to the identity of the organism responsible for nitrogen fixation in Trichodesmium aggregates. By using degenerate oligonucleotide primers, it has been possible to amplify, clone, and sequence a segment of the nifH gene from a natural assemblage of Trichodesmium thiebautii. Examination of the DNA and presumed amino acid sequence shows that the gene is most closely related to that of Anabaena spp. and therefore is most likely a cyanobacterial nifH gene.

Risk prediction for suicide in schizophrenia is known to be complex. We undertook a systematic review of all original studies concerning suicide in schizophrenia published since 2004. We found 51 data-containing studies (from 1281 studies screened) that met our inclusion criteria, and ranked these by standardized quality criteria. Estimates of rates of suicide and risk factors associated with later suicide were identified, and the risk factors were grouped according to type and strength of association with suicide. Consensus on the lifetime risk of suicide was a rate of approximately 5%. Risk factors with a strong association with later suicide included being young, male, and with a high level of education. Illness-related risk factors were important predictors, with number of prior suicide attempts, depressive symptoms, active hallucinations and delusions, and the presence of insight all having a strong evidential basis. A family history of suicide, and comorbid substance misuse were also positively associated with later suicide. The only consistent protective factor for suicide was delivery of and adherence to effective treatment. Prevention of suicide in schizophrenia will rely on identifying those individuals at risk, and treating comorbid depression and substance misuse, as well as providing best available treatment for psychotic symptoms.",

People with epilepsy had a 3-fold increased risk of any unnatural mortality and a 5-fold increased risk of unintentional medication poisoning; psychotropic and opioid, but not antiepileptic, drugs were most commonly used in poisoning. \n           \n           \n             Meaning \n             Clinicians should provide advice on unintentional injury and poisoning and suicide prevention and consider the toxicity of concomitant medication when prescribing drugs for people with epilepsy. \n           \n        \n           \n             Importance \n             People with epilepsy are at increased risk of mortality, but, to date, the cause-specific risks of all unnatural causes have not been reported. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             To estimate cause-specific unnatural mortality risks in people with epilepsy and to identify the medication types involved in poisoning deaths. \n           \n           \n             Design, Setting, and Participants \n             This population-based cohort study used 2 electronic primary care data sets linked to hospitalization and mortality records, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) in England (from January 1, 1998, to March 31, 2014) and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank in Wales (from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2014). Each person with epilepsy was matched on age (within 2 years), sex, and general practice with up to 20 individuals without epilepsy. Unnatural mortality was determined using  International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision  codes V01 through Y98 in the Office for National Statistics mortality records. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated in each data set using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, and meta-analyses were conducted using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models.

In both data sets, 51% of the epilepsy and comparison cohorts were male, and the median age at entry was 40 years (interquartile range, 25-60 years) in the CPRD cohorts and 43 years (interquartile range, 24-64 years) in the SAIL cohorts. People with epilepsy were significantly more likely to die of any unnatural cause (HR, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.43-3.16), unintentional injury or poisoning (HR, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.54-3.48) or suicide (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.51-3.07) than people in the comparison cohort. Particularly large risk increases were observed in the epilepsy cohorts for unintentional medication poisoning (HR, 4.99; 95% CI, 3.22-7.74) and intentional self-poisoning with medication (HR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.01-12.53). Opioids (56.5% [95% CI, 43.3%-69.0%]) and psychotropic medication (32.3% [95% CI, 20.9%-45.3%)] were more commonly involved than antiepileptic drugs (9.7% [95% CI, 3.6%-19.9%]) in poisoning deaths in people with epilepsy. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions and Relevance \n             Compared with people without epilepsy, people with epilepsy are at increased risk of unnatural death and thus should be adequately advised about unintentional injury prevention and monitored for suicidal ideation, thoughts, and behaviors.

It has been estimated that there are 350 million chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers worldwide. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection varies geographically, from high (>8%), intermediate (2-7%) to low (<2%) prevalence. HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (e-CHB) and occult HBV infection are two special clinical entities, and the prevalence and clinical implications remain to be explored. The predominant routes of transmission vary according to the endemicity of the HBV infection. In areas with high HBV endemicity, perinatal transmission is the main route of transmission, whereas in areas with low HBV endemicity, sexual contact amongst high-risk adults is the predominant route. HBV has been classified into 7 genotypes, i.e. A to G, based on the divergence of entire genome sequence and HBV genotypes have distinct geographical distributions. Three main strategies have been approved to be effective in preventing HBV infection. They are behavior modification, passive immunoprophylaxis, and active immunization.

Pain medication was prescribed, but they were not able to identify the source of the pain. \n\nAs the pain persisted on and January 2021 rolled around, my mom pursued a consultation with an endodontist, who decided that a root canal on tooth #15 needed to be administered and may be the source of the pain. This procedure was completed, but in the days and weeks following, the pain persisted, now radiating from the jaw, along the side of the head, to the back of the head and shoulders. \n\nIn Late January, she then consulted with an Oral Surgeon to see if anything could be done. At this point, the working theory was that the source of pain was from trigeminal neuralgia. Pain medication was recommended. \n\nIn February, she had a follow-up appointment with the endodontist, who now believed this was a TMJ issue. Later that month, she was referred to and went to a consultation with a TMJ specialist. The specialist believed there was no TMJ issue, and the occipital nerve was irritated and/or inflamed, ultimately causing the incessant pain she had been experiencing for now months. This specialist began (and continues to at present) treating this by way of injections in the back of the skull to help the nerve. The shots are comprised of steroids and lidocaine. The shots have proven to provide temporary relief for a couple hours, but ultimately the pain returns. The expectation was that over a handful of months, it would \u2018calm\u2019 the nerve down and the problem would go away. \n\nAs the weeks went by and the \u2018nerve shot\u2019 treatment continued, she pursued advice from yet another dentist who carried a reputation of being able to address matters like. This dentist quickly arrived at nerve damage/pain, but not in any way related to the dental work completed immediately for the pain began. \n\nIt\u2019s now been over 8 months and my mom is still in severe, debilitating pain. It\u2019s clearly impacting her quality of life. She\u2019s lost a concerning amount of weight because she can hardly eat due to the pain. She loathes taking medication of any kind and does not want to use it as a band-aid to the problem. An MRI was just completed and is being shared with all specialists involved, but the initial review of it indicated there\u2019s nothing \u2018remarkable\u2019. \n\nOther useful information:\n\n\\- Female, 58 years old, Caucasian\n\n\\- Non-smoker, non-drinker\n\n\\- No car accidents or other sources of trauma that could be the \u2018trigger\u2019 to the pain\n\n\\- Pain began within a couple days following wisdom tooth extraction. Pain described as burning and aching. No pulsing/throbbing/tingling\n\n\\- Medications prescribed by various doctors\n\no Gabapentin, 300mg\n\no Carbamazepine, 100mg\n\no Cyclobenzapine, 5mg\n\nWe\u2019re desperate to get any ideas as to what the cause and solution to this pain could be. All input would be most appreciated.",

We present a case of an intra-alveolar dressing (zinc-oxide eugenol paste) that mimicked a trigeminal neuralgia for 3 years and caused a right maxillary chronic osteomyelitis and foreign body reaction in a zone corresponding to the alveolus of the maxillary first molar. This long-term complication was successfully managed by complete removal of the foreign body and curettage of the affected area.",

Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess whether the phenotypes differed by demographic characteristics. Covariate-adjusted mixed-effect models evaluated changes in BMI  z  scores ( z BMI), diet, physical activity, and screen time across phenotypes. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Among parents, 5 digital phenotypes were identified:  socially engaged  (35/214, 16.3%),  independently engaged  (18/214, 8.4%) ( socially  and  independently engaged  parents are those who used mainly the social or the behavioral features of the app, respectively),  fully engaged  (26/214, 12.1%),  partially engaged  (32/214, 15%), and  unengaged  (103/214, 48.1%) users. Married parents were more likely to be  fully engaged  than  independently engaged  ( P =.02) or  unengaged  ( P =.01) users.  Socially engaged  parents were older than  fully engaged  ( P =.02) and  unengaged  ( P =.01) parents. The latent class analysis revealed 4 phenotypes among children:  fully engaged  (32/214, 15%),  partially engaged  (61/214, 28.5%),  dabblers  (42/214, 19.6%), and  unengaged  (79/214, 36.9%) users.  Fully engaged  children were younger than  dabblers  ( P =.04) and  unengaged  ( P= .003) children.  Dabblers  lived in higher-income households than  fully  and  partially engaged  children ( P =.03 and  P =.047, respectively).  Fully engaged  children were more likely to have  fully engaged  ( P <.001) and  partially engaged  ( P <.001) parents than  unengaged  children. Compared with  unengaged  children,  fully  and  partially engaged  children had decreased total sugar ( P =.006 and  P =.004, respectively) and energy intake ( P =.03 and  P =.04, respectively) after 3 months of app use.  Partially engaged  children also had decreased sugary beverage intake compared with  unengaged  children ( P =.03). Similarly, children with  fully engaged  parents had decreased  z BMI, whereas children with  unengaged  parents had increased  z BMI over time ( P =.005). Finally, children with  independently engaged  parents had decreased caloric intake, whereas children with  unengaged  parents had increased caloric intake over time ( P =.02). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Full parent-child engagement is critical for the success of mHealth interventions.

    "question": "21M, 6'1\" (185 cm) and 155 lbs (70 kg), no existing medical issues or medications, no smoking/drinking/drug use\n\nI have had (what I believe to be)  chronic paronychia on 4 fingers on my right hand lasting over 8 weeks. I  started using clotrimazole/Lotrimin twice a day 4 weeks ago and it  almost went away. Once it was almost gone, I started applying Lotrimin  only once a day. I also soaked it from time to time. Recently the  paronychia has come back and I am applying twice a day again. Could this be because I was soaking it in water (I read this as advice for acute paronychia but perhaps this does not apply at all to chronic paronychia)? I also wash dishes every night.\n\nI believe the problem initially started because my hands were not  properly moisturized in the winter and became dry and cracked, making  them vulnerable to infection. I also speculate that the source of the  fungus may be from my winter gloves that I have continued to wear (and  sweat in while riding my bike or running) until recently over the past  several weeks - is that possible? I am wondering why it is on many  fingers at once.\n\nThe infection  began in areas of cracked skin near the cuticles. It has inhabited  different parts of each finger over the past several weeks. Currently it  is mostly on the bottom of my index finger and pinky. It is a little  hard to see. The areas are inflamed and slightly sensitive to touch.\n\nPictures: [\n\nIs the infection likely to go away now that I have stopped soaking it? Am I doing the right treatment?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI continued applying clotrimazole/Lotrimin once a day for about a week, applied topical steroid (CeraVe hydrocortisone cream 1%) to inflamed areas and near cuticle on 3 separate days, started wearing dishwashing gloves and moisturizing several times a day. After a week the swelling had subsided significantly. By now (May 16th, over 2 weeks since this post) the swelling is mostly if not completely gone.",
    "document": "Management of Chronic Paronychia\nChronic paronychia is an inflammatory disorder of the nail folds of a toe or finger presenting as redness, tenderness, and swelling. It is recalcitrant dermatoses seen commonly in housewives and housemaids. It is a multifactorial inflammatory reaction of the proximal nail fold to irritants and allergens. Repeated bouts of inflammation lead to fibrosis of proximal nail fold with poor generation of cuticle, which in turn exposes the nail further to irritants and allergens. Thus, general preventive measures form cornerstone of the therapy. Though previously anti-fungals were the mainstay of therapy, topical steroid creams have been found to be more effective in the treatment of chronic paronychia. In recalcitrant cases, surgical treatment may be resorted to, which includes en bloc excision of the proximal nail fold or an eponychial marsupialization, with or without nail plate removal. Newer therapies and surgical modalities are being employed in the management of chronic paronychia. In this overview, we review recent epidemiological studies, present current thinking on the pathophysiology leading to chronic paronychia, discuss the challenges chronic paronychia presents, and recommend a commonsense approach to management.",

We searched five trials registers and checked articles for references to relevant randomised controlled trials. \n           \n           \n             Selection criteria \n             We included randomised controlled trials of H1\u2010antihistamines for CSU.

We present risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \n           \n           \n             Main results \n             We identified 73 studies (9759 participants); 34 studies provided data for 23 comparisons. The duration of the intervention was up to two weeks (short\u2010term) or longer than two weeks and up to three months (intermediate\u2010term). \n             Cetirizine 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term led to complete suppression of urticaria by more participants than was seen with placebo (RR 2.72, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.91). For this same outcome, comparison of desloratadine versus placebo in the intermediate term (5 mg) (RR 37.00, 95% CI 2.31 to 593.70) and in the short term (20 mg) (RR 15.97, 95% CI 1.04 to 245.04) favoured desloratadine, but no differences were seen between 5 mg and 10 mg for short\u2010term treatment. \n             Levocetirizine 20 mg per day (short\u2010term) was more effective for complete suppression of urticaria compared with placebo (RR 20.87, 95% CI 1.37 to 317.60), and at 5 mg was effective in the intermediate term (RR 52.88, 95% CI 3.31 to 843.81) but not in the short term, nor was 10 mg effective in the short term. \n             Rupatadine at 10 mg and 20 mg in the intermediate term achieved a 'good or excellent response' compared with placebo (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77). \n             Loratadine (10 mg) versus placebo (RR 1.86, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.79) and loratadine (10 mg) versus cetirizine (10 mg) (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.43) over short\u2010term and intermediate\u2010term treatment showed no significant difference for 'good or excellent response' or for complete suppression of urticaria, respectively. \n             Loratadine (10 mg) versus desloratadine (5 mg) (intermediate\u2010term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.71). For loratadine (10 mg) versus mizolastine (10 mg) (intermediate\u2010term), no statistically significant difference was seen for complete suppression of urticaria (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.16) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.42). \n             Loratadine (10 mg) versus emedastine (2 mg) (intermediate\u2010term) showed no statistically significant difference for complete suppression (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.39) or for 'good or excellent response' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24); the quality of the evidence was moderate for this comparison. \n             No difference in short\u2010term treatment was noted between loratadine (10 mg) and hydroxyzine (25 mg) in terms of complete suppression (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.32 to 3.10). \n             When desloratadine (5 to 20 mg) was compared with levocetirizine (5 to 20 mg), levocetirizine appeared to be the more effective (P value < 0.02). \n             In a comparison of fexofenadine versus cetirizine, more participants in the cetirizine group showed complete suppression of urticaria (P value < 0.001). \n             Adverse events leading to withdrawals were not significantly different in the following comparisons: cetirizine versus placebo at 10 mg and 20 mg (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 13.22); desloratadine 5 mg versus placebo (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.42 to 5.10); loratadine 10 mg versus mizolastine 10 mg (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.04 to 3.60); loratadine 10 mg versus emedastine 2 mg (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.07 to 17.14); cetirizine 10 mg versus hydroxyzine 25 mg (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.45); and hydroxyzine 25 mg versus placebo (RR 3.64, 95% CI 0.77 to 17.23), all intermediate term. \n             No difference was seen between loratadine 10 mg versus mizolastine 10 mg in the proportion of participants with at least 50% improvement in quality of life (RR 3.21, 95% CI 0.32 to 32.33). \n           \n           \n             Authors' conclusions \n             Although the results of our review indicate that at standard doses of treatment, several antihistamines are effective when compared with placebo, all results were gathered from a few studies or, in some cases, from single\u2010study estimates. The quality of the evidence was affected by the small number of studies in each comparison and the small sample size for many of the outcomes, prompting us to downgrade the quality of evidence for imprecision (unless stated for each comparison, the quality of the evidence was low). \n             No single H1\u2010antihistamine stands out as most effective. Cetirizine at 10 mg once daily in the short term and in the intermediate term was found to be effective in completely suppressing urticaria. Evidence is limited for desloratadine given at 5 mg once daily in the intermediate term and at 20 mg in the short term. Levocetirizine at 5 mg in the intermediate but not short term was effective for complete suppression. Levocetirizine 20 mg was effective in the short term, but 10 mg was not. No difference in rates of withdrawal due to adverse events was noted between active and placebo groups. Evidence for improvement in quality of life was insufficient. \n           \n        \n           Plain language summary \n           \n             H1\u2010antihistamines for chronic spontaneous urticaria \n           \n           \n             Background \n           \n           Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) is a condition characterised by a rash of red itchy raised weals or hives, which appear for no identifiable reason. Other names include chronic idiopathic or chronic ordinary urticaria. 'Spontaneous' differentiates this type of urticaria from 'inducible' or 'physical' urticaria, for which there are specific triggers such as cold or pressure. 'Chronic' indicates that the condition has continued for at least six weeks. Hives may be intensely itchy, and the appearance may be unsightly and distressing to sufferers. In some cases, hives can be accompanied by deeper swelling, known as angio\u2010oedema, which is most common around the eyes and mouth. \n           Antihistamine drugs, specifically H1 antihistamines, are the mainstay of treatment for urticaria, although they control the condition rather than cure it. Many antihistamines are available to buy without a prescription, including brand names such as Clarityn, Piriton, Zirtek, Benadryl and Phenergan (brand names may differ by country). \n           \n             Review question \n           \n           Which H1\u2010antihistamines are effective and safe for CSU? \n           \n             Study characteristics \n           \n           We included 73 randomised controlled trials, with 9759 participants of all ages and looked for complete suppression of urticaria. The duration of the intervention was up to two weeks (short\u2010term) or longer than two weeks and up to three months (intermediate\u2010term). \n           \n             Key results \n           \n           We investigated clinical trials in which one therapy was compared against another or against placebo (direct comparisons). We found that for general use, 10 mg once daily of cetirizine for short\u2010term and intermediate\u2010term duration was effective in completely suppressing urticaria, although not in all individuals. Some benefit may be associated with use of desloratadine at 5 mg for at least an intermediate term and at 20 mg in the short term. Levocetirizine at 5 mg was effective for complete suppression in the intermediate term but not in the short term. A higher dose of 20 mg was effective in the short term, but 10 mg was not. \n           Adverse events, such as headache or dry mouth, are tolerable with most antihistamines. Evidence is less clear for improvement in quality of life (e.g. reduction in sleep disturbance from itching, less distress from the appearance of hives) as many studies did not address this. \n           We cannot say whether one antihistamine works better than all the rest, as we did not have head\u2010to\u2010head evidence for every possible treatment comparison. \n           \n             Quality of the evidence \n           \n           The overall quality of the evidence found for most outcomes was low. Further well\u2010designed and carefully reported comparative studies are required, if we are to find out how well these medicines work, and if any adverse effects are reported, especially over periods of up to several months.",

    "question": "I'm not a healthy person but I'm working on it. This current issue has really negatively impacted my life and made it hard to function.\n\nIn January 2019, I was diagnosed with Graves\u2019 disease. My TSH was undetectable and my FT3 and FT4 were slightly elevated. I was placed on 10 mg propranolol and 30 mg of methimazole daily. A couple of months later, I was able to get off the propranolol and go to 5 mg of methimazole 5x a week.\n\nHowever, in February 2020, I began showing symptoms of hyperthyroidism again. I was between insurance and had moved but called my old endocrinologist. They upped my dose to 10mg based on my word.\n\nOnce I got insurance and saw a new endocrinologist, I was retested. My most recent labs showed that my thyroid is leveling out and normal, if not bordering on hypothyroidism. A thyroid ultrasound found a few small nodules (&lt; 1cm) and a normal-sized thyroid.\n\nWhile I was severely hyperthyroid a year ago, my symptoms no longer make sense.\n\nMy heart rate is through the roof (90 resting, 110-120 sitting, and 130-160 while moving). I\u2019ve tried 4 beta-blockers (short- and long-acting) and none of them lower my heart rate. An echocardiogram revealed palpitations and dyspnea on exertion. But nothing else was wrong.\n\nI have no temperature regulation. I\u2019m dizzy and have balance issues. I have muscle weakness. I\u2019m always trembling. My vision changes and feels off. I have anxiety but medication, mindfulness, and therapy the past few months has not helped. My concentration and memory are shot. I\u2019m tired all the time but can\u2019t sleep. I feel spacey. The list goes on.\n\nI finally got an endocrinologist who is willing to do some investigative work and she thinks my symptoms may not be related to my thyroid.\n\nI have two questions:\n\n1. Why would beta-blockers NOT work to lower my heart rate when they have before? Why am I still trembling?\n2. If it's not my thyroid, what is it? What other diseases might mimic hyperthyroidism?\n\nMy endocrinologist is looking for other problems potentially related to my adrenal or pituitary glands but I would like some insight into what might be happening?\n\nThank you!\n\nMore Info:\n\nConfirmatory/additional info: \n\n* Negative for pheochromocytoma.\n* Normal thyroid levels, slightly hypo.

We report\u00a0a case of a 21-year-old male who had Hashitoxicosis of two years duration before converting to Hashimoto\u2019s hypothyroidism. He initially presented with complaints of increased appetite, heat intolerance, fatigue, and sweating. On a physical exam, he had mild exophthalmos with lid lag and a\u00a0fine tremor in the hands. Thyroid function tests also confirmed that the patient had hyperthyroidism. Thyroglobulin antibody and thyroid peroxidase antibody were both positive. He also had mildly elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) but decreased radioactive iodine uptake scan.\u00a0Based on the clinical presentation and biochemical test, a diagnosis of Hashitoxicosis was made. This hyperthyroid phase lasted for a period of\u00a0two years.\u00a0The patient eventually developed hypothyroidism suggesting that Hashimoto's thyroiditis was the\u00a0most likely diagnosis. He was started on levothyroxine replacement therapy and remained euthyroid on levothyroxine since that day. The initial presentation mimicked\u00a0Grave\u2019s disease, but with decreased radioiodine uptake, despite the high TSI level, leading\u00a0us to treat him medically and not with radioactive iodine therapy. The patient was thus spared unnecessary radioactive iodine therapy \u00a0 (RAI) therapy.",

    "document": "Daith Piercing in a Case of Chronic Migraine: A Possible Vagal Modulation\nDaith piercing is an ear piercing located at the crus of the helix, bilaterally. It is getting great consent on social media as alternative treatment in chronic migraine. No data about its efficacy and action are available in scientific literature so far. We present the case of a 54-year-old male patient suffering from refractory chronic migraine with medication-overuse, who substantially improved after bilateral ear daith piercing. His migraine was refractory to symptomatic as well as prophylactic therapies. He used to treat headaches with up to five symptomatic drugs per attack and had attempted several pharmacological preventive therapies, including Onabotulinumtoxin A. He also underwent detoxification treatments with intravenous steroids and diazepam, without durable benefit. At the time of daith piercing, the headache-related disability measures showed a HIT-6 score of 64, a MIDAS-score of 70, and a 11-point Box scale of 5. On his own free will, he decided to get a \u201cdaith piercing.\u201d After that, he experienced a reduction of migraine attacks, which became very rare, and infrequent, less disabling episodes of tension-type headache (HIT-6 score of 56; MIDAS score of 27, 11-point Box scale of 3). Painkiller assumption has much decreased: he takes only one tablet of indomethacin 50\u2009mg to treat tensive headaches, about four times per month. Beyond a placebo effect, we can speculate a vagal modulation as the action mechanism of daith piercing: a nociceptive sensory stimulus applied to trigeminal and vagal areas of the ear can activate ear vagal afferents, which can modulate pain pathways by means of projections to the caudal trigeminal nucleus, to the locus coeruleus and to the nucleus raphe magnus. Currently, daith piercing cannot be recommended as migraine treatment because of the lack of scientific evidence, the unquantified rate of failure and the associated risks with insertion. However, given the increasing but anecdotal evidence, we think that the mechanism needs testing by means of a controlled clinical trial in a population of chronic migraineurs.",

    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

    "question": "*edited again 9/24/2021*\nHe was diagnosed with a rare disease called MALS syndrome (compression of the celiac artery). Thank you for everyone\u2019s input. Funny enough he\u2019s been told to smoke pot again to gain weight because part of the reason his attacks are so bad at the moment is because he\u2019s too skinny, compressing his celiac artery more than usual. Thought I\u2019d share as this might help someone else. For years he had GI doctors tell him it\u2019s not GI. It\u2019s hard to diagnose as it\u2019s extremely rare and you have to under go severa tests. They\u2019re going to use a celiac pain blocker first before they try surgery. \n\n\n\n*edited to add more descriptions of symptoms* \n\nI\u2019ve known the man for 12 years and we recently started dating less than a year ago. I heard about his \u201cattacks\u201d as his family has dubbed them, even when we were friends. One incident in particular left him in a hospital for two weeks, many years ago. \n\nHe has severe left side pain, that makes him feel nauseas and he will continue to throw up for hours. He takes hot showers to soothe him and he hops in and out of the shower for several hours, the whole time he\u2019s throwing up. I\u2019ve seen him do it for up to 14 hrs before he resigned and asked me to call the paramedics.\n\n\nNow before I get the crazy stares why don\u2019t I take him to ER right away. I\u2019ve gone to many hospitals with him. He\u2019s had attacks while in the hospital and the nurses, drs at certain hospitals just don\u2019t give a fuck. It\u2019s the most disheartening thing to watch. You go to the hospital to feel better, safe. No, not in his case. Some drs are great others are dicks. \n\nHe did have state health insurance until just this past month. Since we\u2019ve changed the level of care has gotten better at certain places, it\u2019s been hard to get him to see specialists such as gi, oncologist, vascular, neurologist   the list goes on. Some of these drs take months to get into. For the past three weeks I\u2019ve been taking him to the hospital every 48-72 hrs as another attack comes on. Making it impossible to keep some of these appointments. (He has been able to see a GI who is going to scope him next week.) \n\nThe only way to stop the pain and attacks are IV medication, we\u2019ve tried other things before; he throws it up. They usually give him narcotics, zofran, and an IV bag. His veins are all bruised as it\u2019s been harder and harder to find good veins. \n\nBefore you ask no he\u2019s not a drug addict. He doesn\u2019t even drink, 7 years ago they thought it was his gallbladder and removed it. He has also done a nuclear study that showed how his digestive system moves food. I don\u2019t know what this means but they said 1,2 where great and functioned normally but 3,4 and 5 were abnormal. He takes reglan 1-3 times a day, protonix and bentle? (Sp). He also takes Xanax at night and occasionally smokes medical marijuana to help with sleep and hunger. As you can imagine eating is scary for him. These attacks usually come after eating. And just about eating anything, even from drinking water. Also having a bowel movement can bring on an attack. \n\nI\u2019m watching my boy friend die in front  of my eyes. \n\nAfter lots of conversations he even remembers having similar episodes when he was younger and would hide it from his parents. \n\nHe has had mri\u2019s, mra\u2019s, cat scans, blood work, endoscopy, colonoscopy. Everything comes back clean.And yes he is still getting another colostomy and endoscopy on Wednesday because his Gi doesn\u2019t think the hospital he was at were competent( apparently they have a bad reputation) only weird thing that has shown up is that his blood is inflamed. Hopefully fingers crossed he can make that appt tomorrow. He is currently fighting an attack off. He doesn\u2019t want to go to the hospital bc my daughters birthday is Saturday. \n\nWe are willing to try anything at this point. Any suggestions I\u2019m all ears. Please let me know if you need more info. It\u2019s hard to fit it all in and remember every detail that I feel can possibly make a difference. \n\n\nThank you in advanced\n\n****thank you for all the responses I have not been able to read through all the comments but I would like to add a few things. \n\n- how extreme the left pain is not normal. It\u2019s constant pain that he deals with daily, at about a level 7. Once it reaches a ten this is what brings on the nausea. When he goes to drs it is so tender it cant even be touched, (same area as your liver). He has had this pain since he was a child, he says it was always his soft spot, if someone ever fight him that would be where to attack (you can visually see a difference from his right and left side when he\u2019s naked, the skin even feels different where it hurts him). He used to play football in high school and once got tackled straight on in that area with a helmet, they had to take him off the field on a stretcher. \n\n- he\u2019s more than willing to stop smoking if it\u2019s going to make him better. He\u2019s stopped before for 1.5 years and still had these attacks. Usually when he goes through a fit like this he will quit for a couple weeks. \n\n- he has been diagnosed with gastroparis and that\u2019s why he takes the reglan although not all of the gi\u2019s agree and think this is a more extreme case \n\n- he is 44\n\n- his attacks were similar when he was younger with how he feels the acid reflux coming on. He wouldn\u2019t vomit. His stomach would get hard, usually brought on by drinking drinks from the fountain. He has always had this pain on his left side just not as severe it\u2019s gotten worse with the years \n\n- he is afraid to eat because these attacks usually happen after a bowel movement. \n\n- also during these attacks his arms go numb, usually the left one\n\n-his heart rate goes insanely up while in pain \n\n- he becomes almost incoherent he can\u2019t speak properly, slurs, I always know when he knocks out of it because we can hold a conversation again. \n\n-he sometimes shakes in bed and sweats under the blankets, runs high fevers and sweats them out\n\n-he has had many gi\u2019s from different hospitals he gets admitted to tell him this is not a gi issue. They believe it\u2019s something else. We\u2019ve been told neurological, nerves from his spine.",
    "document": "Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome\nCoinciding with the increasing rates of cannabis abuse has been the recognition of a new clinical condition known as Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, and frequent hot bathing. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome occurs by an unknown mechanism. Despite the well-established anti-emetic properties of marijuana, there is increasing evidence of its paradoxical effects on the gastrointestinal tract and CNS. Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabigerol are three cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant with opposing effects on the emesis response. The clinical course of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome may be divided into three phases: prodromal, hyperemetic, and recovery phase. The hyperemetic phase usually ceases within 48 hours, and treatment involves supportive therapy with fluid resuscitation and anti-emetic medications. Patients often demonstrate the learned behavior of frequent hot bathing, which produces temporary cessation of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The broad differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting often leads to delay in the diagnosis of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome shares several similarities with CHS and the two conditions are often confused. Knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and natural course of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is limited and requires further investigation.",

Participants also completed Likert-scale ratings regarding their perceptions of the prompting system. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS \n             Results revealed that participants in the transition-based context prompting condition responded to the first prompt more frequently and rated the system as more convenient, natural, and appropriate compared to participants in the time-based condition. \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSIONS \n             Our findings suggest that prompting during activity transitions produces higher adherence to the first prompt and more positive perceptions of the prompting system. This is an important finding given the benefits of prompting technology and the possibility of improving cognitive interventions by using context-aware transition prompting.",

The benefits of polyunsaturated fatty acid appear small compared to the effect sizes observed for traditional pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Some evidence suggests that polyunsaturated fatty acid formulations with higher eicosapentaenoic acid may be more effective in improving ADHD symptoms. Melatonin appears to be effective in treating chronic insomnia in children with ADHD but appears to have minimal effects in reducing core ADHD symptoms. Iron and zinc supplementation may have benefit in reducing ADHD symptoms in children with or at high risk of deficiency. Data demonstrating efficacy of iron, zinc or magnesium in non-nutrient deficient ADHD populations is lacking. Many other natural supplements are widely utilized in the United States despite minimal evidence of efficacy and possible side-effects.",

    "document": "Biological relevance of ZNF224 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication IN NF-kB pathway regulation\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, whose presentation and clinical course are highly variable. Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",

    "document": "Sleeping hours: what is the ideal number and how does age impact this?\nThe objective of this narrative review paper is to discuss about sleep duration needed across the lifespan. Sleep duration varies widely across the lifespan and shows an inverse relationship with age. Sleep duration recommendations issued by public health authorities are important for surveillance and help to inform the population of interventions, policies, and healthy sleep behaviors. However, the ideal amount of sleep required each night can vary between different individuals due to genetic factors and other reasons, and it is important to adapt our recommendations on a case-by-case basis. Sleep duration recommendations (public health approach) are well suited to provide guidance at the population-level standpoint, while advice at the individual level (eg, in clinic) should be individualized to the reality of each person. A generally valid assumption is that individuals obtain the right amount of sleep if they wake up feeling well rested and perform well during the day. Beyond sleep quantity, other important sleep characteristics should be considered such as sleep quality and sleep timing (bedtime and wake-up time). In conclusion, the important inter-individual variability in sleep needs across the life cycle implies that there is no \u201cmagic number\u201d for the ideal duration of sleep. However, it is important to continue to promote sleep health for all. Sleep is not a waste of time and should receive the same level of attention as nutrition and exercise in the package for good health.",

A novel device is now available that offers an easy route for administration of medications or fluids via rectal mucosal absorption (also referred to as proctoclysis in the case of fluid administration and subsequent absorption). Although originally intended for the palliative care market, the utility of this device in the emergency setting has recently been described. Specifically, reports of patients being treated for dehydration, alcohol withdrawal, vomiting, fever, myocardial infarction, hyperthyroidism, and cardiac arrest have shown success with administration of a wide variety of medications or fluids (including water, aspirin, lorazepam, ondansetron, acetaminophen, methimazole, and buspirone). Device placement is straightforward, and based on the observation of expected effects from the medication administrations, absorption is rapid. The rapidity of absorption kinetics are further demonstrated in a recent report of the measurement of phenobarbital pharmacokinetics. We describe here the placement and use of this device, and demonstrate methods of pharmacokinetic measurements of medications administered by this method.",

    "document": "Practical guidance for applying the ADNEX model from the IOTA group to discriminate between different subtypes of adnexal tumors\nAll gynecologists are faced with ovarian tumors on a regular basis, and the accurate preoperative diagnosis of these masses is important because appropriate management depends on the type of tumor. Recently, the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) consortium published the Assessment of Different NEoplasias in the adneXa (ADNEX) model, the first risk model that differentiates between benign and four types of malignant ovarian tumors: borderline, stage I cancer, stage II-IV cancer, and secondary metastatic cancer. This approach is novel compared to existing tools that only differentiate between benign and malignant tumors, and therefore questions may arise on how ADNEX can be used in clinical practice. In the present paper, we first provide an in-depth discussion about the predictors used in ADNEX and the ability for risk prediction with different tumor histologies. Furthermore, we formulate suggestions about the selection and interpretation of risk cut-offs for patient stratification and choice of appropriate clinical management. This is illustrated with a few example patients. We cannot propose a generally applicable algorithm with fixed cut-offs, because (as with any risk model) this depends on the specific clinical setting in which the model will be used. Nevertheless, this paper provides a guidance on how the ADNEX model may be adopted into clinical practice.",

These are the sort of ovarian lesions that have elaborate algorithms for how to monitor/refer because most of the time they're *not* cancer and don't need intensive follow-up, but shouldn't be ignored either. The rules change if you have a BRCA mutation, so they're getting it out of there to minimize risk. But it doesn't sound *remotely* like anything that has gone crazy and metastasized or anything like that... it's just an indeterminate cystic thing that really needs to come out instead of be left alone."

I hope someone can help me out here.\n\nEssentially, I had a sexual encounter with a female escort about 6 weeks ago. The vaginal sex was protected, the insertive oral sex was not.\n\n**Week 1:** Started noticing penile discharge, and began experiencing painful urination and an itchy urethra. The discharge was white/transparent and had a foul odor. These symptoms continue to this day, but to a lesser extent.\n\n**Week 2:** Became extremely fatigued, lost my appetite, vision became blurry, felt confused, low grade fever, chills, discharge from the eyes, etc. These symptoms continue to this day (except the low grade fever and chills), but to a lesser extent. Went to the doctor, got tested for Chlamydia/Gonorrhea/Syphillis, all came out negative a week later.\n\n**Week 3/4:** Started experiencing joint pain and rashes. The joint pain and rashes were mostly present at the extremities, so my hands and feet (and arms/legs). The rashes were pustular usually, and would go away in a few days. Unfortunately, I did not take a photo at the time this was happening. They were itchy sometimes. There were some on my back as well. In regards to the joint pain, one of my pinky fingers got swollen one day, and the skin was red. One of my toes was also red one day, but that went away as well. I feel like there is still stiffness in my fingers. And my hands go numb when I am in bed sometimes. I went to the urgent care unit at the hospital, and was treated with 250mg ceftriaxone and 1g azithromycin. I felt better that day mentally and physically, and for the next 2-3 days. But eventually, the above symptoms returned. And continued for the next couple of weeks. Not sure if that was placebo or not. Chlamydia/Gonorrhea/Syphillis/HIV/Urine Culture all came back negative.\n\n**Week 5/6 (Now):** The symptoms from Week 3/4 have mostly gone away by this time. There is still some joint pain and maybe some minor rashes, here and there. But now the main issue is, that I've started experiencing headaches, and I feel like my organs hurt a bit sometimes. So sometimes, I experience some pain in the kidneys or the liver. And I still feel fatigued, with no appetite, and I feel confused mentally. I have had to take time off work, and haven't done anything in about 6 weeks.\n\nI saw another doctor about 1 week ago, and he thought it was Mononucleosis, but the monospot test came back negative since then (and this was about 5 weeks post sexual encounter, so it was probably accurate). Also, the doctor asked if I was still getting discharge from the penis, and I said no. But recently, I noticed the discharge again. And it smells bad. Does that mean it's a bacterial infection? Could it be disseminated gonorrhea? I feel like a lot of my symptoms match with disseminated gonorrhea. But the two doctors that I visited, I asked them if this could be it, and they said it's highly unlikely. And based on my research, it seems that disseminated gonorrhea is unlikely to be detected from urine. Or could this be herpes? But I have not really noticed any obvious rashes or lesions in the genital area.\n\nI'm so confused. What should I do now? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. My whole life has been put on hold.

    "document": "Epidemiology of Pancreatic Cancer: Global Trends, Etiology and Risk Factors\nPancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, its toll is higher in more developed countries. Reasons for vast differences in mortality rates of pancreatic cancer are not completely clear yet, but it may be due to lack of appropriate diagnosis, treatment and cataloging of cancer cases. Because patients seldom exhibit symptoms until an advanced stage of the disease, pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignant neoplasms that caused 432,242 new deaths in 2018 (GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates). Globally, 458,918 new cases of pancreatic cancer have been reported in 2018, and 355,317 new cases are estimated to occur until 2040. Despite advancements in the detection and management of pancreatic cancer, the 5-year survival rate still stands at 9% only. To date, the causes of pancreatic carcinoma are still insufficiently known, although certain risk factors have been identified, such as tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dietary factors, alcohol abuse, age, ethnicity, family history and genetic factors,  Helicobacter pylori infection , non-O blood group and chronic pancreatitis. In general population, screening of large groups is not considered useful to detect the disease at its early stage, although newer techniques and the screening of tightly targeted groups (especially of those with family history), are being evaluated. Primary prevention is considered of utmost importance. Up-to-date statistics on pancreatic cancer occurrence and outcome along with a better understanding of the etiology and identifying the causative risk factors are essential for the primary prevention of this disease.",

One important question - have you tested positive for gonorrhea/chlamdyia, or simply given the antibioitcs (I've seen the latter happen frequently...).\n\nThe reason I ask is this - Males can get recurrent UTI's from a fistula (a small tunnel) from your bowel to your bladder. Ecoli travels to from your bowel to your bladder and you get a UTI. Ciprofloxcacin is active against all three bugs, so we dont know what the real cause is unless you've actually tested positive.

    "document": "Systematic Literature Review of Imaging Features of Spinal Degeneration in Asymptomatic Populations\nThis meta-analysis of the literature reveals that imaging findings of spine degeneration are present in high proportions of asymptomatic individuals, increasing with age. Many imaging-based degenerative features are likely part of normal aging and unassociated with pain. \n        \n           \n             BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: \n             Degenerative changes are commonly found in spine imaging but often occur in pain-free individuals as well as those with back pain. We sought to estimate the prevalence, by age, of common degenerative spine conditions by performing a systematic review studying the prevalence of spine degeneration on imaging in asymptomatic individuals. \n           \n           \n             MATERIALS AND METHODS: \n             We performed a systematic review of articles reporting the prevalence of imaging findings (CT or MR imaging) in asymptomatic individuals from published English literature through April 2014. Two reviewers evaluated each manuscript. We selected age groupings by decade (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years), determining age-specific prevalence estimates. For each imaging finding, we fit a generalized linear mixed-effects model for the age-specific prevalence estimate clustering in the study, adjusting for the midpoint of the reported age interval. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS: \n             Thirty-three articles reporting imaging findings for 3110 asymptomatic individuals met our study inclusion criteria. The prevalence of disk degeneration in asymptomatic individuals increased from 37% of 20-year-old individuals to 96% of 80-year-old individuals. Disk bulge prevalence increased from 30% of those 20 years of age to 84% of those 80 years of age. Disk protrusion prevalence increased from 29% of those 20 years of age to 43% of those 80 years of age.

    "document": "Anesthetic Requirement is Increased in Redheads\nBackground:  Age and body temperature alter inhalational anesthetic requirement; however, no human genotype is associated with inhalational anesthetic requirement. There is an anecdotal impression that anesthetic requirement is increased in redheads. Furthermore, red hair results from distinct mutations of the melanocortin-1 receptor. We thus tested the hypothesis that the requirement for the volatile anesthetic desflurane is greater in natural redhead than in dark-haired women. \n           Methods:  We studied healthy women with bright red (n=10) or dark (n=10) hair. Blood was sampled for subsequent analyses of melanocortin-1 receptor alleles. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and maintained with desflurane randomly set at an end-tidal concentration between 5.5 and 7.5%. After an equilibration period, a noxious electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 70 mA) was transmitted through bilateral intradermal needles. If the volunteer moved in response to stimulation, desflurane was increased by 0.5%; otherwise it was decreased by 0.5%. This was continued until volunteers \u201ccrossed-over\u201d from movement to non-movement (or vice versa) four times. Individual logistic regression curves were used to determine desflurane requirement (P 50 ). Desflurane requirements in the two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney nonparametric two-sample test;  P  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n           Results : The desflurane requirement in redheads (6.2 volume-percent [95% CI, 5.9 - 6.5]) was significantly greater than in dark-haired women (5.2 volume-percent [4.9 \u2013 5.5],  P  = 0.0004). Nine of 10 redheads were either homozygous or compound heterozygotes for mutations on the melanocortin-1 receptor gene. \n           Conclusions : Red hair appears to be a distinct phenotype linked to anesthetic requirement in humans that can also be traced to a specific genotype.",

    "document": "The molecular basis of herpes simplex virus latency\nHerpes simplex virus type 1 is a neurotropic herpesvirus that establishes latency within sensory neurones. Following primary infection, the virus replicates productively within mucosal epithelial cells and enters sensory neurones via nerve termini.

Periodically, the virus can reactivate to resume its normal lytic cycle gene expression programme and result in the generation of new virus progeny that are transported axonally back to the periphery. The ability to establish lifelong latency within the host and to periodically reactivate to facilitate dissemination is central to the survival strategy of this virus. Although incompletely understood, this review will focus on the mechanisms involved in the regulation of latency that centre on the functions of the virus-encoded latency-associated transcripts (LATs), epigenetic regulation of the latent virus genome and the molecular events that precipitate reactivation. \n           This review considers current knowledge and hypotheses relating to the mechanisms involved in the establishment, maintenance and reactivation herpes simplex virus latency.",

There was no difference in Point A-Nasion-Point B (ANB) angle between the two groups (MD=0.25; 95% CI -0.26 to 0.75; P=0.34). Mouth breathers demonstrated an increased mandibular plane angle, total and lower anterior facial height and decreased posterior facial height. Within the limitations of the study, the results indicated that mouth breathers tended to have a retrognathic maxilla and mandible, vertical growth pattern with high mandibular plane angle, downward and backward rotation of the mandible and an increase in total and lower anterior facial height and decrease in posterior facial height. Further high-quality studies are required to strengthen the evidence on this subject.",

    "document": "Anatomical, functional, physiological and behavioural aspects of the development of mastication in early childhood\nMastication efficiency is defined as the efficiency of crushing food between the teeth and manipulating the resulting particles to form a swallowable food bolus. It is dependent on the orofacial anatomical features of the subject, the coordination of these anatomical features and the consistency of the food used during testing. Different measures have been used to indirectly quantify mastication efficiency as a function of children's age such as observations, food bolus characterisation, muscle activity measurement and jaw movement tracking. In the present review, we aim to describe the changes in the oral physiology (e.g. bone and muscle structure, teeth and soft tissues) of children and how these changes are associated with mastication abilities. We also review previous work on the effect of food consistency on children's mastication abilities and on their level of texture acceptance. The lack of reference foods and differences in testing methodologies across different studies do not allow us to draw conclusions about (1) the age at which mastication efficiency reaches maturity and (2) the effect of food consistency on the establishment of mature mastication efficiency. The effect of food consistency on the development of children's mastication efficiency has not been tested widely. However, both human and animal studies have reported the effect of food consistency on orofacial development, suggesting that a diet with harder textures enhances bone and muscle growth, which could indirectly lead to better mastication efficiency. Finally, it was also reported that (1) children are more likely to accept textures that they are able to manipulate and (2) early exposure to a range of textures facilitates the acceptance of foods of various textures later on. Recommending products well adapted to children's mastication during weaning could facilitate their acceptance of new textures and support the development of healthy eating habits.",

Hazard ratios were calculated for antidepressant class (tricyclic and related antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, other antidepressants), dose, and duration of use and for commonly prescribed individual drugs. \n           Results  54\u2009038 (89.0%) patients received at least one prescription for an antidepressant during follow-up. A total of 1\u2009398\u2009359 antidepressant prescriptions were issued: 764\u2009659 (54.7%) for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 442\u2009192 (31.6%) for tricyclic antidepressants, 2203 (0.2%) for monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and 189\u2009305 (13.5%) for the group of other antidepressants. The associations with the adverse outcomes differed significantly between the antidepressant classes for seven outcomes. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were associated with the highest adjusted hazard ratios for falls (1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.58 to 1.73) and hyponatraemia (1.52, 1.33 to 1.75) compared with when antidepressants were not being used. The group of other antidepressants was associated with the highest adjusted hazard ratios for all cause mortality (1.66, 1.56 to 1.77), attempted suicide/self harm (5.16, 3.90 to 6.83), stroke/transient ischaemic attack (1.37, 1.22 to 1.55), fracture (1.64, 1.46 to 1.84), and epilepsy/seizures (2.24, 1.60 to 3.15), compared with when antidepressants were not being used. Tricyclic antidepressants did not have the highest hazard ratio for any of the outcomes. Significantly different associations also existed between the individual drugs for the same seven outcomes; trazodone (tricyclic antidepressant), mirtazapine, and venlafaxine (both in the group of other antidepressants) were associated with the highest rates for some of these outcomes. Absolute risks over 1 year for all cause mortality were 7.04% for patients while not taking antidepressants, 8.12% for those taking tricyclic antidepressants, 10.61% for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and 11.43% for other antidepressants. \n           Conclusions  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and drugs in the group of other antidepressants were associated with an increased risk of several adverse outcomes compared with tricyclic antidepressants. Among individual drugs, trazodone, mirtazapine, and venlafaxine were associated with the highest risks for some outcomes. As this is an observational study, it is susceptible to confounding by indication, channelling bias, and residual confounding, so differences in characteristics between patients prescribed different antidepressant drugs that could account for some of the associations between the drugs and the adverse outcomes may remain. Further research is needed to confirm these findings, but the risks and benefits of different antidepressants should be carefully evaluated when these drugs are prescribed to older people.",

Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios adjusting for potential confounding variables. \n           Main outcome measures  Suicide and attempted suicide or self harm during follow-up. \n           Results  During follow-up, 87.7% (n=209\u2009476) of the cohort received one or more prescriptions for antidepressants. The median duration of treatment was 221 days (interquartile range 79-590 days). During the first five years of follow-up 198 cases of suicide and 5243 cases of attempted suicide or self harm occurred. The difference in suicide rates during periods of treatment with tricyclic and related antidepressants compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was not significant (adjusted hazard ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 1.50), but the suicide rate was significantly increased during periods of treatment with other antidepressants (2.64, 1.74 to 3.99). The hazard ratio for suicide was significantly increased for mirtazapine compared with citalopram (3.70, 2.00 to 6.84). Absolute risks of suicide over one year ranged from 0.02% for amitriptyline to 0.19% for mirtazapine. There was no significant difference in the rate of attempted suicide or self harm with tricyclic antidepressants (0.96, 0.87 to 1.08) compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but the rate of attempted suicide or self harm was significantly higher for other antidepressants (1.80, 1.61 to 2.00). The adjusted hazard ratios for attempted suicide or self harm were significantly increased for three of the most commonly prescribed drugs compared with citalopram: venlafaxine (1.85, 1.61 to 2.13), trazodone (1.73, 1.26 to 2.37), and mirtazapine (1.70, 1.44 to 2.02), and significantly reduced for amitriptyline (0.71, 0.59 to 0.85). The absolute risks of attempted suicide or self harm over one year ranged from 1.02% for amitriptyline to 2.96% for venlafaxine. Rates were highest in the first 28 days after starting treatment and remained increased in the first 28 days after stopping treatment. \n           Conclusion  Rates of suicide and attempted suicide or self harm were similar during periods of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic and related antidepressants. Mirtazapine, venlafaxine, and trazodone were associated with the highest rates of suicide and attempted suicide or self harm, but the number of suicide events was small leading to imprecise estimates. As this is an observational study the findings may reflect indication biases and residual confounding from severity of depression and differing characteristics of patients prescribed these drugs. The increased rates in the first 28 days of starting and stopping antidepressants emphasise the need for careful monitoring of patients during these periods.",

Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",

No stress, great job with excellent job security, family is amazing, plenty of money, no debt, etc.  First symptoms appeared 8 years ago, but have been getting consistently and progressively worse with time.  Have gone from mild inconvenience at first to now having a severe impact on my daily life.  \n\nI realize this is extremely long, so it\u2019s organized by sections, current symptoms, a brief history on these symptoms, and finally all of the medical tests that have been performed to date.  Any and all suggestions of what this could be, or what to potentially go from here are greatly welcome.  I\u2019m hoping someone here has read a relevant case study or has some other thoughts.  There really are no stupid ideas at this point.\n\n------------\n**Current symptoms** in order of suckiness (all have been progressively getting worse with time) :\n\n- **Persistent headaches + cognitive difficulty:**  This one is hard to describe, but feels like a combination of being drunk and how your head feels when you have a severe flu.  I\u2019m currently feeling at about \u201c3 flus + 6 beers\u201d on a daily basis.  It started off as a minor annoyance 8 years ago, but feels like I have to concentrate on just standing now.  Have to constantly write even the most basic stuff down in order to remember it (despite having gotten a Ph.D. in Physics), and can\u2019t drive more than 15 minutes at a time despite having raced cars at one point (that's self-imposed.  It\u2019s a fatigue vs spatial awareness thing.  It\u2019s like someone is turning down the power on my CPU and I can only focus on a single car after a few minutes of driving).  This is coupled with worsening headaches.  Basically, I constantly feel sick now to the point where I rarely physically feel well enough anymore to go out and do stuff, and it's still progressively getting worse.  I would easily prefer having a the flu each day to whatever this BS is.\n\n- **Fatigue**: get 8 hours of sleep a night, exercise daily, but still feel fairly severe fatigue throughout the day.  Frequently have to take a nap just to feel a tiny bit better.\n\n- **Parasthesia** : Various tingling & burning sensations (extremities, face+head)  These typically last anywhere from several hours to days, but are getting worse in both severity and duration with time.  Occasional slight muscle weakness in various isolated muscles which also mostly resolves within a week.\n\n- **Heart palpitations** + occasional episodes tachycardia lasting a few days at a time: Normal blood pressure is 120/80, resting heart rate in the 75-85 range.  Heart likes to skip beats and that is getting worse with time.  There will be periods of 2-3 days where resting heart rate will jump up to the 120ish range without any apparent external cause.\n\n- **Shortness of breath**: Also hard to describe exactly, but there are episodes (again lasting on the order of days) where it feels like it requires a little more mental effort to breathe in.  Not like anything is obstructed, but like I consciously notice it feeling 20% harder to take a breath.\n\n\n**History:** \nFirst symptoms appeared almost 8 years (3/2010).  Was perfectly healthy prior to this point, and had visited a doctor maybe 3-4 times total as an adult.  I woke up in the middle of the night with this weird sensation where it felt a little harder to breathe in.  Ignored it and went to sleep.  The next morning I woke up with this sort of cognitive fog or haze.  When that didn\u2019t go away for several days I made a doctor\u2019s appointment, so they started running tests.  A few weeks later the left side of my face went almost completely numb, so I went to the ER.  They also did not find anything, and that numbness resolved completely after a few days.  Things have been going downhill since then without any apparent medical explanation.\n\n**Diagnostic Tests run** (all normal unless otherwise noted): \n\n-\tEKG (at least a dozen over the past 8 years)\n-\tChest X-ray\n-\tChest CT (they were worried about a DVT at that ER-visit early on)\n-\tEchocardiogram\n-\tCardiac stress test (non-nuclear)\n-\tCardiac CT (Small non-dominant RCA, mildly dilated RV, both considered unremarkable by cardiologist)\n-\tHolter (2x the small patch type and 2x of those beeper-sized thingys over the past 8 years, some skipped beats, some extra beats, and some tachycardia recorded but cardiologist did not see anything that worried them, does not believe that my symptoms are related to any kind of arrhythmia and is convinced cause must be something more systemic)\n-\tTilt-table\n-\tSleep study (in-home and facility)\n-\t4x MRI 1.5 Tesla Head + C-Spine w/ contrast over the past 8 years (completely clean and no change w.r.t. time)\n-\t1x MRI 1.5 Tesla L-spine w/ contrast (one slight bulging disc.  I do have occasional lower back pain which I suspect is most likely due to excessive sitting) \n-\tNerve conduction test\n\n**Blood tests run** \n\n-\tAllergy (positive for dog, cat, ragweed)\u2026 no pets, symptoms are persistent and not seasonal.  No change w.r.t. OTC antihistamines.\n-\tAllergy Food Panel (None)\n-\tBasically tested for the usual suspects, Lyme antibody negative multiple times, TSH T3 T4 normal, cortisol normal, glucose normal, syphilis negative.  I am going to list the rest of the results that I have available as a table, since I\u2019m not sure what could possibly be relevant at this point or whether we missed any tests.   Basically everything is within range with the exception of (vitamin D low for a period of time but since corrected with supplements, cholesterol trending higher, anion gap trends high, sodium and calcium within range but typically at the high end of the range)\n\n[Lab results part #1](\n\n[Lab results part #2](",
    "document": "Prediction of COVID-19 Infections for Municipalities in the Netherlands: Algorithm Development and Interpretation\nBackground \n             COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China. The virus quickly spread and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. After infection, symptoms such as fever, a (dry) cough, nasal congestion, and fatigue can develop. In some cases, the virus causes severe complications such as pneumonia and dyspnea and could result in death. The virus also spread rapidly in the Netherlands, a small and densely populated country with an aging population. Health care in the Netherlands is of a high standard, but there were nevertheless problems with hospital capacity, such as the number of available beds and staff. There were also regions and municipalities that were hit harder than others. In the Netherlands, there are important data sources available for daily COVID-19 numbers and information about municipalities. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             We aimed to predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands, using a data set with the properties of 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and advanced modeling techniques. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We collected relevant static data per municipality from data sources that were available in the Dutch public domain and merged these data with the dynamic daily number of infections from January 1, 2020, to May 9, 2021, resulting in a data set with 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and variables grouped into 20 topics. The modeling techniques random forest and multiple fractional polynomials were used to construct a prediction model for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The final prediction model had an  R 2  of 0.63. Important properties for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality in the Netherlands were exposure to particulate matter with diameters <10 \u03bcm (PM10) in the air, the percentage of Labour party voters, and the number of children in a household. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Data about municipality properties in relation to the cumulative number of confirmed infections in a municipality in the Netherlands can give insight into the most important properties of a municipality for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality. This insight can provide policy makers with tools to cope with COVID-19 and may also be of value in the event of a future pandemic, so that municipalities are better prepared.",

    "question": "**Background:** 35 year old male caucasian, 6ft 235lb, desk job, 40-60 minutes of cardio daily, DC Metro area, no medications, no drugs whatsoever (Top Secret SCI clearance), mild social drinking (maybe 1-2 alcoholic drinks / month).  No stress, great job with excellent job security, family is amazing, plenty of money, no debt, etc.  First symptoms appeared 8 years ago, but have been getting consistently and progressively worse with time.  Have gone from mild inconvenience at first to now having a severe impact on my daily life.  \n\nI realize this is extremely long, so it\u2019s organized by sections, current symptoms, a brief history on these symptoms, and finally all of the medical tests that have been performed to date.  Any and all suggestions of what this could be, or what to potentially go from here are greatly welcome.  I\u2019m hoping someone here has read a relevant case study or has some other thoughts.  There really are no stupid ideas at this point.\n\n------------\n**Current symptoms** in order of suckiness (all have been progressively getting worse with time) :\n\n- **Persistent headaches + cognitive difficulty:**  This one is hard to describe, but feels like a combination of being drunk and how your head feels when you have a severe flu.  I\u2019m currently feeling at about \u201c3 flus + 6 beers\u201d on a daily basis.  It started off as a minor annoyance 8 years ago, but feels like I have to concentrate on just standing now.  Have to constantly write even the most basic stuff down in order to remember it (despite having gotten a Ph.D. in Physics), and can\u2019t drive more than 15 minutes at a time despite having raced cars at one point (that's self-imposed.  It\u2019s a fatigue vs spatial awareness thing.  It\u2019s like someone is turning down the power on my CPU and I can only focus on a single car after a few minutes of driving).  This is coupled with worsening headaches.  Basically, I constantly feel sick now to the point where I rarely physically feel well enough anymore to go out and do stuff, and it's still progressively getting worse.  I would easily prefer having a the flu each day to whatever this BS is.\n\n- **Fatigue**: get 8 hours of sleep a night, exercise daily, but still feel fairly severe fatigue throughout the day.  Frequently have to take a nap just to feel a tiny bit better.\n\n- **Parasthesia** : Various tingling & burning sensations (extremities, face+head)  These typically last anywhere from several hours to days, but are getting worse in both severity and duration with time.  Occasional slight muscle weakness in various isolated muscles which also mostly resolves within a week.\n\n- **Heart palpitations** + occasional episodes tachycardia lasting a few days at a time: Normal blood pressure is 120/80, resting heart rate in the 75-85 range.  Heart likes to skip beats and that is getting worse with time.  There will be periods of 2-3 days where resting heart rate will jump up to the 120ish range without any apparent external cause.\n\n- **Shortness of breath**: Also hard to describe exactly, but there are episodes (again lasting on the order of days) where it feels like it requires a little more mental effort to breathe in.  Not like anything is obstructed, but like I consciously notice it feeling 20% harder to take a breath.\n\n\n**History:** \nFirst symptoms appeared almost 8 years (3/2010).  Was perfectly healthy prior to this point, and had visited a doctor maybe 3-4 times total as an adult.  I woke up in the middle of the night with this weird sensation where it felt a little harder to breathe in.  Ignored it and went to sleep.  The next morning I woke up with this sort of cognitive fog or haze.  When that didn\u2019t go away for several days I made a doctor\u2019s appointment, so they started running tests.  A few weeks later the left side of my face went almost completely numb, so I went to the ER.  They also did not find anything, and that numbness resolved completely after a few days.  Things have been going downhill since then without any apparent medical explanation.\n\n**Diagnostic Tests run** (all normal unless otherwise noted): \n\n-\tEKG (at least a dozen over the past 8 years)\n-\tChest X-ray\n-\tChest CT (they were worried about a DVT at that ER-visit early on)\n-\tEchocardiogram\n-\tCardiac stress test (non-nuclear)\n-\tCardiac CT (Small non-dominant RCA, mildly dilated RV, both considered unremarkable by cardiologist)\n-\tHolter (2x the small patch type and 2x of those beeper-sized thingys over the past 8 years, some skipped beats, some extra beats, and some tachycardia recorded but cardiologist did not see anything that worried them, does not believe that my symptoms are related to any kind of arrhythmia and is convinced cause must be something more systemic)\n-\tTilt-table\n-\tSleep study (in-home and facility)\n-\t4x MRI 1.5 Tesla Head + C-Spine w/ contrast over the past 8 years (completely clean and no change w.r.t. time)\n-\t1x MRI 1.5 Tesla L-spine w/ contrast (one slight bulging disc.  I do have occasional lower back pain which I suspect is most likely due to excessive sitting) \n-\tNerve conduction test\n\n**Blood tests run** \n\n-\tAllergy (positive for dog, cat, ragweed)\u2026 no pets, symptoms are persistent and not seasonal.  No change w.r.t. OTC antihistamines.\n-\tAllergy Food Panel (None)\n-\tBasically tested for the usual suspects, Lyme antibody negative multiple times, TSH T3 T4 normal, cortisol normal, glucose normal, syphilis negative.  I am going to list the rest of the results that I have available as a table, since I\u2019m not sure what could possibly be relevant at this point or whether we missed any tests.   Basically everything is within range with the exception of (vitamin D low for a period of time but since corrected with supplements, cholesterol trending higher, anion gap trends high, sodium and calcium within range but typically at the high end of the range)\n\n[Lab results part #1](\n\n[Lab results part #2](",

Multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess whether the phenotypes differed by demographic characteristics. Covariate-adjusted mixed-effect models evaluated changes in BMI  z  scores ( z BMI), diet, physical activity, and screen time across phenotypes. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Among parents, 5 digital phenotypes were identified:  socially engaged  (35/214, 16.3%),  independently engaged  (18/214, 8.4%) ( socially  and  independently engaged  parents are those who used mainly the social or the behavioral features of the app, respectively),  fully engaged  (26/214, 12.1%),  partially engaged  (32/214, 15%), and  unengaged  (103/214, 48.1%) users. Married parents were more likely to be  fully engaged  than  independently engaged  ( P =.02) or  unengaged  ( P =.01) users.  Socially engaged  parents were older than  fully engaged  ( P =.02) and  unengaged  ( P =.01) parents. The latent class analysis revealed 4 phenotypes among children:  fully engaged  (32/214, 15%),  partially engaged  (61/214, 28.5%),  dabblers  (42/214, 19.6%), and  unengaged  (79/214, 36.9%) users.  Fully engaged  children were younger than  dabblers  ( P =.04) and  unengaged  ( P= .003) children.  Dabblers  lived in higher-income households than  fully  and  partially engaged  children ( P =.03 and  P =.047, respectively).  Fully engaged  children were more likely to have  fully engaged  ( P <.001) and  partially engaged  ( P <.001) parents than  unengaged  children. Compared with  unengaged  children,  fully  and  partially engaged  children had decreased total sugar ( P =.006 and  P =.004, respectively) and energy intake ( P =.03 and  P =.04, respectively) after 3 months of app use.  Partially engaged  children also had decreased sugary beverage intake compared with  unengaged  children ( P =.03). Similarly, children with  fully engaged  parents had decreased  z BMI, whereas children with  unengaged  parents had increased  z BMI over time ( P =.005). Finally, children with  independently engaged  parents had decreased caloric intake, whereas children with  unengaged  parents had increased caloric intake over time ( P =.02). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Full parent-child engagement is critical for the success of mHealth interventions.

Wet or moist treatment of wounds has been shown to promote re-epithelialization and result in reduced scar formation, as compared to treatment in a dry environment. \n           \n           \n             Recent Advances \n             By treating wounds in a controlled wet environment, delivery of antimicrobials, analgesics, other bioactive molecules such as growth factors, as well as cells and micrografts, is allowed. The addition of growth factors or transplantation of cells yields the possibility of creating a regenerative wound microenvironment that favors healing, as opposed to excessive scar formation. \n           \n           \n             Critical Issues \n             Although several manufacturers have conceived products implementing the concept of moist wound healing, there remains a lack of commercial translation of wet wound-healing principles into clinically available products.

    "question": "Yesterday morning I noticed a few very tiny (1mm or less) fluid-filled blisters between my middle and ring fingers of my left hand. I also noticed at least one or two in similar locations on my right hand, on knuckles or fingers. They do not itch at all, but nevertheless, this has caused me a lot of anxiety, since I had scabies about a year and a half ago and it was fairly long-lasting and miserable. Terrible itching, big ugly blisters on my hands, and lots of time and money spent at the laundromat washing my clothes and blankets every day.\n\nI went ahead and took a dose of Ivermectin this morning, which I had left over from the last time I had scabies, and washed/dried my clothes, blankets, bedding, etc. on hot. I'm going to the walk-in clinic in about an hour to see if I can get any insights.\n\n[Excuse the bad photo quality]( but that's about the best my phone can do. The red one is one that I picked at yesterday, and it leaked a little clear watery fluid. The others are probably too hard to see in the image. They're just tiny little bumps.

A case was defined as the self-reported emergence of fibers or materials from the skin accompanied by skin lesions and/or disturbing skin sensations. We collected detailed epidemiologic data, performed clinical evaluations and geospatial analyses and analyzed materials collected from participants' skin. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             We identified 115 case-patients.

Case-patients had a median age of 52 years (range: 17\u201393) and were primarily female (77%) and Caucasian (77%).

The strings are still in the place I expect to feel them. I stopped having periods a few months after the Mirena was installed (lol, is there a term better for this?). I honestly have no freaking clue how far along I am.\n\nAbout 6ish weeks ago, I had heartburn and heart palpitations for the first time in my life. I didn't think much of it because it wasn't very painful, and I could eat, sleep, workout, etc, and feel completely normal. I just cut back on my caffeine intake and felt better. \n\nThen, about two(?) ...maybe three (?) weeks ago my breasts became sore and swollen. I randomly decided to take home pregnancy test,  just to rule it out. Sure enough, it came back positive. I ran out and bought a second more expensive name brand test. Positive again. Needless to say, I'm freaked out as fuck. I wasn't expecting this. I'm scared about complications because I've heard pregnancy with an IUD is dangerous. \n\nI immediately called Planned Parenthood (where I got the IUD installed) to get an appointment. This call was a frustrating experience, but to make a long story short they can't see me for nearly 3 weeks! \n\nWhen I Google \"pregnant with IUD\" Some of the internet tells me to go directly to the ER, other internets don't seem that concerned. \n\nDoctors and medical professionals of reddit, do I need to go the ER ASAP or is it safe to wait for my PP appointment?",
    "document": "Early Lung Disease Exhibits Bacteria-Dependent and -Independent Abnormalities in Cystic Fibrosis Pigs\nRationale:  Although it is clear that cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease begins at a very young age, the early and subsequent steps in disease pathogenesis and the relative contribution of infection, mucus, and inflammation are not well understood. \n           Objectives:  As one approach to assessing the early contribution of infection, we tested the hypothesis that early and continuous antibiotics would decrease the airway bacterial burden. We believed that, if they do, this might reveal aspects of the disease that are more or less sensitive to decreasing infection. \n           Methods:  Three groups of pigs were studied from birth until \u223c3 weeks of age:  1 ) wild-type,  2 ) CF, and  3 ) CF pigs treated continuously with broad-spectrum antibiotics from birth until study completion. Disease was assessed with chest computed tomography, histopathology, microbiology, and BAL. \n           Measurements and Main Results:  Disease was present by 3 weeks of age in CF pigs. Continuous antibiotics from birth improved chest computed tomography imaging abnormalities and airway mucus accumulation but not airway inflammation in the CF pig model. However, reducing bacterial infection did not improve two disease features already present at birth in CF pigs: air trapping and submucosal gland duct plugging. In the CF sinuses, antibiotics did not prevent the development of infection or disease or the number of bacteria but did alter the bacterial species. \n           Conclusions:  These findings suggest that CF airway disease begins immediately after birth and that early and continuous antibiotics impact some, but not all, aspects of CF lung disease development.",
    "response": "I am a medical student so literally anyone please chime in with other info, but I would recommend seeking care urgently. A Mirena IUD can increase your risk of ectopic pregnancy, which depending on how far along you are and how fast it's growing, can absolutely be a medical emergency.  An ectopic pregnancy is functionally a tumor growing where it shouldn't, and very quickly!  If it's located somewhere like your fallopian tubes, you can risk losing a tube and/or needing emergency surgery. Depending on whether you want to carry this to term or not, an IUD can increase risk of miscarriage, preterm birth, and infection which you definitely want to avoid either way.\n\nAre there any other Planned Parenthoods in the area? Any Ob/Gyn offices that take your insurance or Medicaid (if you have either) or that do sliding scale care? Does that Planned Parenthood do any evening clinics that are walk-in anywhere, or have separate appointments that are just for an ultrasound to figure out if your pregnancy is somewhere safe? If you've already received care, they might even give you an \"order\" for an ultrasound that you could take to an outside lab and get done sooner, but that depends on the policy and how much an outside lab would cost (sometimes cheaper than in-office!).\n\nThere are many many cases where pregnancy + IUD ends up totally fine, but pregnancy stuff is an area that pretty much every medical professional is not willing to fuck around with because the risks can be so high, so that may affect my answer."

    "document": "Repeated insulin injection without site rotation affects skin thickness \u2013 ultrasonographic and histological evaluation\nAbstract \n           \n             Aims/Introduction \n             The influence of repeated insulin injection on subcutaneous tissue is known, but its impact on the skin is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the impact of repeated insulin injections on the skin. \n           \n           \n             Material and Methods \n             The properties of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue were evaluated in 52 insulin\u2010treated adult patients with diabetes with abnormal findings at the site of self\u2010injection (36 with subcutaneous nodules, 16 with suspected subcutaneous tissue induration) by ultrasonography. In all subjects, both normal and abnormal areas were examined. In addition, skin biopsies were performed in four subjects. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The skin thickness of the normal and abnormal skin sites was 1.95 (1.60, 2.50) and 2.80 (2.27, 3.30) mm, respectively (median (first quartile, third quartile)), ( P\u2009 <\u20090.001). The biopsy specimens revealed slightly thickened and tight bundles of collagen in the dermis. Three patients had amyloid deposits in the subcutaneous tissue, and one also showed these in the dermis. These were positively stained for insulin antibody. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Repeated insulin injection procedures result in skin thickening. Increased collagen fibers and possibly amyloid deposition in the dermis may be involved. The results reaffirmed the importance of appropriate site rotation in insulin injection and revealed the usefulness of ultrasonographic skin examination in evaluating the self\u2010injection procedure. \n           \n        \n           Repeated insulin injection without rotation increases skin thickness.",

The mechanisms of SMT remain unclear; however, pain sensitivity testing may provide insight into these mechanisms. The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the literature on the hypoalgesic effects of SMT on pain sensitivity measures and to quantify these effects using meta-analysis. We performed a systematic search of articles using CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus from each databases\u2019 inception until May 2011. We examined methodological quality of each study and generated pooled effect size estimates using meta-analysis software. Of 997 articles identified, 20 met inclusion criteria for this review. Pain sensitivity testing used in these studies included chemical, electrical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli applied to various anatomical locations. Meta-analysis was appropriate for studies examining the immediate effect of SMT on mechanical pressure pain threshold (PPT). SMT demonstrated a favorable effect over other interventions on increasing PPT. Subgroup analysis showed a significant effect of SMT on increasing PPT at the remote sites of stimulus application supporting a potential central nervous system mechanism. Future studies of SMT related hypoalgesia should include multiple experimental stimuli and test at multiple anatomical sites.",

I put pass out in quotation marks because often times I would still have consciousness, but I couldn't speak or see. Sometimes I would break out in sweats and feel very noxious. I would usually be able to call out and lay down before falling over. My warning signs were a sound I would describe as being like a white noise machine, or insects rubbing their wings together. Doctor basically just said deal with it.\n\nAbout 2 years ago this changed to a very specific situation. It didn't happen very often, but when I turn my head to the right side (as in ear to shoulder), my left arm would go numb and I would lose vision in one or both eyes. If I turned my head to the left side my right arm would go numb without loss of vision.\n\n\nNow fast forward to 2018 and this happens every single day. Except it's worse. I often have very little to no warning when I pass out. I had to skip this semester of college because I had two major falls, one caused me to get a concussion and fractured nose as well as major bruises, one just caused major bruises. My neck also feels constantly stiff, so when I stretch it my eyesight blackouts as well. I spent a few days in the hospital where they tested me for a bunch of things. Here were the results:\n\n\n-a ct with contrast ink: Normal\n\n-Chest xray: normal\n\n-Right Arterial Duplex Ultrasound: now this is where it gets a bit weird: \"Very little to no flow in the right subclavian artery while the patient tilts her head to the right, highly suggesting thoracic outlet obstruction.\"\n\n\nSo I thought they found it but then they repeated that test:\nCerebrovascular Duplex - Complete/Bilateral Ultrasound: No evidence of significant arterial occlusive disease in the common, internal,\nand external carotid arteries bilaterally.\n\n\nNormal flow in the right subclavian artery with and without provocative\nmaneuvers.\n\n\nAntegrade flow in both vertebral arteries with no hemodynamically significant\nchange in flow patterns with provocative maneuvers bilaterally.\n\n\nThe provocative maneuvers used during this exam were the traditional turning of\n the head to both sides in addition to using the same neck and head position\nthat clinically causes the patient to have her symptoms.\n\n\nIt's important to note that in the first test that found the abnormality I started losing vision. In the second one I did not.\n\n\nSo after that they told me that most young girls pass out when they turn their head to the side and discharged me. I am going to still try and figure out whats wrong because I don't believe them. I was hoping that maybe some of you could point me in the right direction o what it might be so I can figure out what tests I should try to get.\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who helped me out. For the first time in a while I feel validated and like there may actually be a solution.

    "document": "Eagle Syndrome Causing Vascular Compression with Cervical Rotation: Case Report\nSummary \n           \n             Background \n             Eagle syndrome is a condition caused by an elongated styloid process. Unilateral face, neck and ear pain, stinging pain, foreign body sensation and dysphagia can be observed with this syndrome. Rarely, the elongated styloid process may cause pain by compressing the cervical segment of the internal carotid and the surrounding sympathetic plexus, and that pain spreading along the artery can cause neurological symptoms such as vertigo and syncope. \n           \n           \n             Case Report \n             In this case report we presented a very rare eagle syndrome with neurological symptoms that occurred suddenly with cervical rotation. The symptoms disappeared as suddenly as they occurred, with the release of pressure in neutral position. We also discussed CT angiographic findings of this case. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Radiological diagnosis of the Eagle syndrome that is manifested with a wide variety of symptoms and causes diagnostic difficulties when it is not considered in the differential diagnosis is easy in patients with specific findings. CT angiography is a fast and effective examination in terms of showing compression in patients with the Eagle syndrome that is considered to be atypical and causes vascular compression.",
    "response": "The arterial Doppler finding is abnormal, important, and indicates that the problem is vascular. Combined with your bilateral symptoms, it seems to me that the vascular studies are looking too high; that there must be something going on in the upper mediastinum, rather than above the clavicles.\n\nWhat parts of your body did the CT cover? Neck up, or did it include your chest?\n\nI'd talk to a family doctor, and ask if it's worth seeing a vascular (or even cardiothoracic) surgeon, or perhaps having some imaging of your upper chest more than an X-ray. I'd be very interested in an angiogram from the aortic arch up, ideally while you're symptoms are provoked, but this has risks you'd have to discuss probably with the specialist.\n\n A family doc might be able to get some clues from simpler tests like MRI or ultrasound (but I'm not sure if ultrasound can get a good view of the aortic arch and branches, unless it's transesophageal).\n\nEdit - I agree that a large vessel vasculitis like Takayasu should be considered.\n\nI'd still start with a family physician, they can probably arrange some appropriate blood tests and maybe an MRA of the aotiic arch and subclavians (best done on a day your symptoms are flaring up), and discuss whether to see a rheumatologist or a vascular surgeon (or both)."

I swear sometimes I want to leave so badly while I\u2019m at work just so I can go home and sleep. \n\nI always wake up after 7-8 hours of sleep. I\u2019ll have to get up and do something for a couple hours then I can manage to fall back asleep for another 1-2 hours. I do not think it\u2019s mental health related because when I have the time for a nap I usually feel better\u2014more energetic and clearheaded. The problem I have is the beneficial effects of a nap don\u2019t last too long. I may feel refreshed for only 1-3 hours after my nap. Although brief without napping I wouldn\u2019t know what it feels to have a refreshing good nights sleep.

    "document": "Nasal Involvement in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome\nNumerous studies have reported an association between nasal obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), but the precise nature of this relationship remains to be clarified. This paper aimed to summarize data and theories on the role of the nose in the pathophysiology of sleep apnea as well as to discuss the benefits of surgical and medical nasal treatments. A number of pathophysiological mechanisms can potentially explain the role of nasal pathology in OSAS. These include the Starling resistor model, the unstable oral airway, the nasal ventilatory reflex, and the role of nitric oxide (NO). Pharmacological treatment presents some beneficial effects on the frequency of respiratory events and sleep architecture. Nonetheless, objective data assessing snoring and daytime sleepiness are still necessary. Nasal surgery can improve the quality of life and snoring in a select group of patients with mild OSAS and septal deviation but is not an effective treatment for OSA as such. Despite the conflicting results in the literature, it is important that patients who are not perfectly adapted to CPAP are evaluated in detail, in order to identify whether there are obstructive factors that could be surgically corrected.",

    "question": "I'm a 32 year old female living in Massachusetts, US.\n\nI had a mammogram about two weeks ago.  They said they found something called an intraductal papilloma in my left breast.  It was my first ever mammogram and I don't have any symptoms related to this, so we don't know if I've had it for days, months or years.\n\nI met with a surgeon yesterday.  I learned that only 1% of intraductal papillomas are malignant.  I was given two options: wait 6 months and see if there are any changes, or have surgery now to have it removed and biopsied.  The doctor said that waiting 6 months should be fine and the biggest reason to have the surgery immediately would be if I'm too anxious to wait.\n\nI've talked to a few people in my family, including my cousin.  She's a nurse and she said that if she were me, she'd have the surgery now instead of waiting.\n\nI'm just a bit confused about how I'd benefit from waiting.  If intraductal papillomas don't just go away on their own, does that mean I could potentially just leave it there forever and be fine if things don't change?\n\nBasically, since it's a pretty uninvasive surgery, why should I bother waiting 6 months?

    "document": "Are We Overtreating Papillomas Diagnosed on Core Needle Biopsy?\nBackground \n             Breast papillomas often are diagnosed with core needle biopsy (CNB). Most studies support excision for atypical papillomas, because as many as one half will be upgraded to malignancy on final pathology. The literature is less clear on the management of papillomas without atypia on CNB. Our goal was to determine factors associated with pathology upgrade on excision. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Our pathology database was searched for breast papillomas diagnosed by CNB during the past 10 years. We identified 277 charts and excluded lesions associated with atypia or malignancy on CNB. Two groups were identified: papillomas that were surgically excised (group 1) and those that were not (group 2). Charts were reviewed for the subsequent diagnosis of cancer or high-risk lesions.

Eighty-two lesions were excised (42%). Caucasian women were more likely to undergo excision ( p  = 0.03). Twelve percent of excised lesions were upgraded to malignancy. Increasing age was a predictor of upgrading, but this was not significant. Clinical presentation, lesion location, biopsy technique, and breast cancer history were not associated with pathology upgrade. Two lesions in group 2 ultimately required excision due to enlargement, and both were upgraded to malignancy. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Twenty-four percent of papillomas diagnosed on CNB have upgraded pathology on excision\u2014half to malignancy.

    "document": "Blastocystis: Consensus of treatment and controversies\nBlastocystis  is a highly controversial protozoan parasite. It has been variably regarded as a commensal and pathogen. Scientists have for decades wondered whether it is truly an enteropathogen and if it is observed in symptomatic patients whether treatment is required because patient recovery and improvement has been noted even without any treatment. Though associated with self-limiting infection, treatment is warranted in many patients due to persistence of symptoms. This particularly holds true for children and adults who are immuno compromised. Several drugs have been used to treat  Blastocystis  but each one of them has produced widely variable rates of clinical cure and eradication of the parasite from the feces. Based on the studies carried out  in vitro  and clinical responses obtained in patients, metronidazole appears to be the most effective drug for  Blastocystis  infection. However, the therapy is complicated due to different dosages and regimens adopted and the unresponsiveness to treatment observed in several sections of the population studied. Recently, the finding of different subsets of  Blastocystis  exhibiting resistance to metronidazole and associated with variable degrees of symptoms has underscored the importance of typing the subsets of the parasite in order to foretell the clinical response and the need to treat. Till date, the mode of action of the drugs used and the mechanism of resistance is not entirely known and is a topic of speculation. Other drugs with anti  Blastocystis  activity and used in therapy includes trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and nitazoxanide. Several other compounds have also been evaluated for the treatment either alone or in combination with the first or second line drugs. A lot of interest has also been generated on the role of probiotics particularly  Saccharomyces boularrdii  and other natural food compounds on eradication of the parasite. This review provides a comprehensive overview of antimicrobials used to target  Blastocystis  and discusses the issues pertaining to drug resistance, treatment failure, reinfection, and the current views on treatment modalities.",

It's been a day since it happened. Pooping is hard, nothing feels like it can come out, but i managed to get some out, There were 2 occasions where i managed to get a piece of poop out which im pretty sure i got toilet paper out, because i discected it and it looked papery, but i think theres one or two more pieces and they just wont come. I went to bed and woke up and started pooping and i narrowly managed to poop after strruggling but i dont think any paper came out since i discected it and it looked like poop (dont judge me im really scared).\n\nAnyways i really feel something up my butt and i dont know how to get it out, and telling my mom to take me to the er because i have something up my butt is embarassing as hell, so i really want to avoid it, and since i pooped out two pieces i dont think its awful so please give me advice to remove it.\n\nmy mom also has laxitives i can try taking and go pretty unnoticed by them but i want that as a last possible resort\n\n\nafter getting 2 pieces out i would think its not actually there and irritated but then it wouldnt make sense why i cant poop.

    "document": "Stopping or reducing dietary fiber intake reduces constipation and its associated symptoms\nAIM: To investigate the effect of reducing dietary fiber on patients with idiopathic constipation. \n           METHODS: Sixty-three cases of idiopathic constipation presenting between May 2008 and May 2010 were enrolled into the study after colonoscopy excluded an organic cause of the constipation. Patients with previous colon surgery or a medical cause of their constipation were excluded. All patients were given an explanation on the role of fiber in the gastrointestinal tract. They were then asked to go on a no fiber diet for 2 wk. Thereafter, they were asked to reduce the amount of dietary fiber intake to a level that they found acceptable. Dietary fiber intake, symptoms of constipation, difficulty in evacuation of stools, anal bleeding, abdominal bloating or abdominal pain were recorded at 1 and 6 mo. \n           RESULTS: The median age of the patients (16 male, 47 female) was 47 years (range, 20-80 years). At 6 mo, 41 patients remained on a no fiber diet, 16 on a reduced fiber diet, and 6 resumed their high fiber diet for religious or personal reasons. Patients who stopped or reduced dietary fiber had significant improvement in their symptoms while those who continued on a high fiber diet had no change. Of those who stopped fiber completely, the bowel frequency increased from one motion in 3.75 d (\u00b1 1.59 d) to one motion in 1.0 d (\u00b1 0.0 d) ( P  < 0.001); those with reduced fiber intake had increased bowel frequency from a mean of one motion per 4.19 d (\u00b1 2.09 d) to one motion per 1.9 d (\u00b1 1.21 d) on a reduced fiber diet ( P  < 0.001); those who remained on a high fiber diet continued to have a mean of one motion per 6.83 d (\u00b1 1.03 d) before and after consultation. For no fiber, reduced fiber and high fiber groups, respectively, symptoms of bloating were present in 0%, 31.3% and 100% ( P  < 0.001) and straining to pass stools occurred in 0%, 43.8% and 100% ( P  < 0.001). \n           CONCLUSION: Idiopathic constipation and its associated symptoms can be effectively reduced by stopping or even lowering the intake of dietary fiber.",

    "document": "A Decrease in Temperature and Humidity Precedes Human Rhinovirus Infections in a Cold Climate\nBoth temperature and humidity may independently or jointly contribute to the risk of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections, either through altered survival and spread of viruses in the environment or due to changes in host susceptibility. This study examined the relationship between short-term variations in temperature and humidity and the risk of HRV infections in a subarctic climate. We conducted a case-crossover study among conscripts ( n  = 892) seeking medical attention due to respiratory symptoms during their military training and identified 147 HRV cases by real-time PCR. An average temperature, a decline in daily ambient temperature and absolute humidity (AH) during the three preceding days of the onset (hazard period) and two reference periods (a week prior and after the onset) were obtained. The average daily temperature preceding HRV infections was \u22129.9 \u00b1 4.9 \u00b0C and the average AH was 2.2 \u00b1 0.9 g/m 3 . An average (odds ratios (OR) 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00\u20131.15)) and maximal (OR 1.08 (1.01\u20131.17)) change in temperature increased the risk of HRV infections by 8% per 1 \u00b0C decrease. An average (OR 1.20 (CI 1.03\u20131.40)) and maximal decrease (OR 1.13 (CI 0.96\u20131.34)) in AH increased the risk of HRV infection by 13% and 20% per 0.5 g/m 3  decrease. A higher average temperature during the three preceding days was positively associated with HRV infections (OR 1.07 (CI 1.00\u20131.15)). A decrease rather than low temperature and humidity per se during the preceding few days increases the risk of HRV infections in a cold climate.

In early childhood, PTE effects were mostly behavioral outcomes including activity and inattention and externalizing behaviors, including conduct disorder and antisocial behavior. In adolescents, PTE predicted increased attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, modulation of the cerebral cortex and white matter structure, and nicotine addiction. Several studies found moderating effects with PTE and genetic susceptibilities including dopamine transporter, serotonergic synaptic function, and monomine oxidase pathways. Other studies suggested that environmental and genetic factors might be more important than the direct teratological effects of PTE. \n           \n           \n             Summary \n             The majority of studies reviewed were prospective and tobacco exposure was quantified biologically.

Furthermore, despite small increases in smokeless tobacco use in the United States, no prior study has evaluated TTP among smokeless tobacco users. \n           \n           \n             Methods: \n             Using population-based sampling in 16 counties in Michigan and Texas, 501 couples discontinuing contraception to become pregnant were followed until positive pregnancy test or 12 months of trying. Participants were interviewed on lifetime and current cigarette, cigar, and chew/snuff (smokeless) use and provided blood samples for quantification of heavy metals and cotinine. Fecundability odds ratios (FORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated, adjusted for demographics/lifestyle. FORs less than 1 reflect longer TTP. \n           \n           \n             Results: \n             Eleven percentage of females and 15% of males smoked cigarettes. Among men, 14% smoked cigars, 9% used snuff, and 2% used chew. Compared with never tobacco users, male (FOR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.68) and female (FOR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.85) smoking were individually associated with longer TTP; males\u2019 smoking remained significant (FOR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.79) when modeling partners together. Cadmium levels were higher in smokers than smokeless tobacco and never users; adjusting for cadmium attenuated the cigarette\u2013TTP association, particularly among women. TTP was shorter among smokeless tobacco users relative to smokers (FOR: 2.86, 95% CI: 1.47, 5.57). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions: \n             Compared with never users, smokeless tobacco did not alter TTP in our cohort; however, TTP was shorter compared with smokers.

    "document": "Short and long term health effects of parental tobacco smoking during pregnancy and lactation: a descriptive review\nA great deal of attention has been focused on adverse effects of tobacco smoking on conception, pregnancy, fetal, and child health. The aim of this paper is to discuss the current evidence regarding short and long-term health effects on child health of parental smoking during pregnancy and lactation and the potential underlying mechanisms. Studies were searched on MEDLINE \u00ae  and Cochrane database inserting, individually and using the Boolean ANDs and ORs, \u2018pregnancy\u2019, \u2018human lactation\u2019, \u2018fetal growth\u2019, \u2018metabolic outcomes\u2019, \u2018obesity\u2019, \u2018cardiovascular outcomes\u2019, \u2018blood pressure\u2019, \u2018brain development\u2019, \u2018respiratory outcomes\u2019, \u2018maternal or paternal or parental tobacco smoking\u2019, \u2018nicotine\u2019. Publications coming from the reference list of studies were also considered from MEDLINE. All sources were retrieved between\n2015-01-03 and 2015-31-05. There is overall consistency in literature about negative effects of fetal and postnatal exposure to parental tobacco smoking on several outcomes: preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome, neurodevelopmental and behavioral problems, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, impaired lung function, asthma and wheezing. While maternal smoking during pregnancy plays a major role on adverse postnatal outcomes, it may also cumulate negatively with smoking during lactation and with second-hand smoking exposure. Although this review was not strictly designed as a systematic review and the PRISMA Statement was not fully applied it may benefit the reader with a promptly and friendly readable update of the matter. This review strengthens the need to plan population health policies aimed to implement educational programs to hopefully minimize tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy and lactation.",

    "document": "Protein kinase C activates an H+ (equivalent) conductance in the plasma membrane of human neutrophils.\nThe rate of metabolic acid generation by neutrophils increases greatly when they are activated. Intracellular acidification is prevented in part by Na+/H+ exchange, but a sizable component of H+ extrusion persists in the nominal absence of Na+ and HCO3-. In this report we determined the contribution to H+ extrusion of a putative H+ conductive pathway and its mode of activation. In unstimulated cells, H+ conductance was found to be low and unaffected by depolarization. An experimental system was designed to minimize the metabolic acid generation and membrane potential changes associated with neutrophil activation. By using this system, beta-phorbol esters were shown to increase the H+ (equivalent) permeability of the plasma membrane. The direction of the phorbol ester-induced fluxes was dictated by the electrochemical H+ gradient. Moreover, the parallel migration of a counterion through a rheogenic pathway was necessary for the displacement of measurable amounts of H+ equivalents across the membrane. These findings suggest that the H+ flux is conductive. The effect of beta-phorbol esters was mimicked by diacylglycerol and mezerein and was blocked by staurosporine, whereas alpha-phorbol esters were ineffective. Together, these findings indicate that stimulation of protein kinase C induces the activation of an H+ conductance in the plasma membrane of human neutrophils. Preliminary evidence for activation of a separate, bafilomycin A1-sensitive H+ extrusion mechanism, likely a vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase, is also presented.",

Methods:  A hundred patients with alcohol dependence, resistant to usual treatments, were treated with escalating doses of baclofen (no superior limit). Alcohol consumption (in grams) and craving for alcohol were assessed before treatment and at 3, 6, 12, and 24\u2009months. Assessments were simply based on patients\u2019 statements. The outcome measure was the consumption of alcohol, rated according to the World Health Organization criteria for risk of chronic harm.  Results:  While all patients were rated \u201cat high risk\u201d at baseline, approximately half of them were rated \u201cat low risk\u201d at 3, 6, 12, and 24\u2009months. The sum of patients who were at \u201clow risk\u201d and at \u201cmoderate risk\u201d (improved patients) was 84% at 3\u2009months, 70% at 6\u2009months, 63% at 1\u2009year, and 62% at 2\u2009years. The constancy of improvement over the 2-years was remarkable. The average maximal dose of baclofen taken was 147\u2009mg/day. Ninety-two percentage of patients reported that they experienced the craving-suppressing effect of baclofen. Significant relationships were found between the amount in grams of alcohol taken before treatment and the maximal dose of baclofen required, and between the existence of a mental disorder and a lesser effect of baclofen.  Conclusion:  Baclofen produces an effortless decrease or suppression of alcohol craving when it is prescribed with no superior limit of dose. Potential limitations in the effectiveness of baclofen include the coexistence of a mental disorder, the concomitant use of other psychotropic drugs, a lack of real motivation in patients to stop drinking, and the impossibility to reach the optimal dose of baclofen because of unbearable side-effects (sometimes possibly related to too sharp a protocol of dose escalation).",

    "document": "Benefit Versus Risk Assessment of Rotavirus Vaccination in France: A Simulation and Modeling Analysis\nIntroduction \n             Two vaccines against rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in young children, Rotarix and RotaTeq, have been available in Europe since 2006. Vaccination against rotaviruses significantly reduces the burden of RVGE, but it is also associated with a very small increased risk of intussusception. In a benefit\u2013risk analysis, the prevented RVGE burden is weighed against the possible excess of intussusception. \n           \n           \n             Purpose \n             The aim was to compare the estimated benefits and risks of Rotarix vaccination in France. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We estimated the benefits (vaccine-preventable RVGE hospitalizations and deaths) and risks (vaccine-caused intussusception hospitalizations and deaths) following two doses of Rotarix in a birth cohort of 791,183 followed for 3\u20135\u00a0years in France. We used data from peer-reviewed clinical and epidemiological studies or publications, and government statistics. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Within the total number of French children below 5\u00a0years of age, we estimate vaccination could prevent a median 11,132 [95% credible interval (CI) 7842\u201314,408] RVGE hospitalizations and 7.43 (95% CI 3.27\u201314.68) RVGE deaths. At the same time, vaccination could cause an average of 6.86 (95% CI 2.25\u201338.37) intussusception hospitalizations and 0.0099 (95% CI 0.0024\u20130.060) intussusception deaths in the entire French birth cohort of infants below 1\u00a0year of age. Therefore, for every intussusception hospitalization and every intussusception death caused by vaccination, 1624 (95% CI 240\u20135243) RVGE hospitalizations and 743 (95% CI 93\u20133723) RVGE deaths are prevented, respectively, by vaccination. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The vaccine-prevented RVGE hospitalizations and deaths (benefit) greatly outweigh the excess potentially vaccination-related cases of intussusception (risk), indicating a favorable benefit\u2013risk balance for Rotarix in France. \n           \n           \n             Electronic supplementary material \n             The online version of this article (10.1007/s40259-018-0273-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",

We recommend vaccination for all infants with one of these two. Before vaccination was widespread, we saw many cases of rotavirus enteritis requiring hospital admission for infants every year. \n\nThere are no mRNA rotavirus vaccines available right now, because mRNA is still a new technology and we have a very effective vaccine already available. Rotarix is a live attenuated vaccine. There is no reason to be \"not fond of\" vaccines of this type - this is similar to the MMR and varicella vaccines, which are also life-saving and extremely effective.\n\nNo need to make any changes in food or vitamin administration around giving this vaccine."

    "response": "So couple things. First off, I\u2019m sorry this is happening, this sounds super stressful. This stuff sounds minor but can really take over people\u2019s lives and I really hope you get answers soon. However I want to reassure you that you\u2019re doing everything right and at least as best as I can tell you\u2019re getting great and effective care. The problem may be in how they are explaining (or not) what they are doing/not and why.\n1) as far as we know, you can\u2019t get Aspergillus vaginally. Like I haven\u2019t even heard of that in severely immune compromised patients. Same with other molds. Molds are actually super fickle organisms and usually have insanely complicated growth requirements so they really will only grow in certain places. Fungal cultures are notoriously difficult to do, and I\u2019m guessing to do one on a vaginal sample would be crazy expensive and not provide anything more than the testing you\u2019ve already gotten. So while it may seem like your physician is being cold, what it sounds like from a medical perspective is they are trying to protect you from unnecessary tests. Similarly, we start with a wet mount because usually all we need to know is \u201cthis is candida\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s BV\u201d and not anything more, and a wet mount is essentially free and done in the office.\n2) a couple ppl have suggested Lichen Sclerosus, which can present similarly to candida. But I would be super surprised to see it in someone their 30\u2019s with no other issues. And it definitely won\u2019t make the discharge you\u2019re talking about.\n3) I would stay away from most \u201cnatural remedies\u201d because in my experience these only tend to make things worse. Your vagina doesn\u2019t need you to give it bicarbonate or tea tree oil or anything else. Sometimes we prescribe boric acid intravaginally to lower the pH, but candida grows at a low pH and so this doesn\u2019t sound like a pH problem.\n4) You may want to consider different formulations of the drugs you\u2019ve gotten. Perhaps a vaginal medicine for the candida will be more effective since it\u2019s direct. You could also try this drug, which is a newer treatment for BV that is just as effective as Flagyl but may work differently for you:  There\u2019s lots of options out there so don\u2019t give up!\n5) Have you gotten testing for colonic flora (thinking E. coli, Enterococcus, etc)? Sometimes that can cross colonize and be a problem. Similarly have you gotten testing for UTIs cause those can co-occur and give a clue as to what is going on?"

    "question": "Blood tests: [\n\nNew handle for privacy, also for my girl. Please help me with my daughter. She's 16, white, 174cm, about 50kg. We're in the Netherlands. No other known conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the last three years she had 4 big super scary attacks after exercise, and some mild smaller ones only lasting 2-3 days. She only gets these attacks when she overdoes things. All seems fine at first, but 2-3 hours later she starts to feel sick and breathes really strangely, as if she can't stop exhaling. For the coming 3-4 weeks every little bit of movement brings this on again. She also says she wakes up at night and it feels like her heart has stopped beating and she jumps out of bed to get it going again as she's afraid she'll otherwise faint. This only happens when she falls asleep properly. She also sighs a lot during daytime and she says it's like someone stole some of the oxigen from the air. No tightness, no pain, no wheezing, not anemic. Again, when she moves and then rests again she gets more air for a while. She says she has left-sided weakness, clumsiness, blurry vision and ants crawling on two spots on her left arm and leg (but not fingers and toes). After 3-4 weeks all is gone again. Doctors don't know what's going on and think she has panic attacks and is hyperventilating. But she is totally calm when this happens. When this happens her urine smells like candy. GP found bit of protein and white blood cells, but no infection. Sugar normal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe's never been good at sport, and she says that most sport, and just climbing stairs or writing makes her muscles hurt so badly. When she learned to write she was always crying because it hurt so much, and I can still see she's suffering when she needs to write a text with pen and paper. She's always been very calm, solitary, sometimes forgets everything around her and even herself, but is good at school. Not many friends. She often experiences what sounds like very low blood sugar, with confusion, muscle weakness, tiredness, she looks pale and stares into nothing, very low blood pressure, and she empties the fridge. This happens when she forgets to eat, is too restless or active for a while, or eats too much fatty snacks or meat (but not when she eats regularly and lots of carbs). And this state continues for hours to days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTested: ECG, lungs test, chest xray, 48hrs ecg (she could not sleep), glucose challenge test, some heart ultrasound. All normal. She also had an addison challenge test (normal), imunoglobulin blood tests (normal). Neurologist: \"What am I supposed to do with this? Never heard of something like this.\" Blood pressure is usually low, but during the last attack she had a few high measurements, but only at doctors and not at home. I've linked to blood tests from two such attacks but left out many normal results because I need to type everything over by hand. Attack A was first tested at 3:00 at night, some 9 hours after trying to do a HIIT video, then again 24hrs later. These tests look very similar to others, though glucose was not tested again. Hb1ac always normal on the low side, thus no idea why glucose was higher then. Attack B was the last one and she didn't know she was developing symptoms. It was tested 30 minutes after we rushed to the hospital (teenagers and time) to discuss this very topic and the doctor wanted to have a base level test. She started to feel sick 2 hours after this test, and again this attack lasted around 4 weeks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are a lot of blues (low) and reds (high) in the blood tests, but no explanation of what's going on. Doctor considers referring her to either an academic hospital with the next attack or we should consider psychosomatic treatment. I just can't imagine that what influences her life so much can be just in her head and I'm looking for new input. I just want to help her, even though she seems least worried, even sleeps well when this happens and is mostly just annoyed by it all.",

I say \u201cbite\u201d because the bite itself didn\u2019t actually break the skin but I had a wound on my hand that was open the day before. After telling animal control this when I filed the lose dog report I was told this was still a rabies risk. The animal control officer said the same thing when he came out to meet me before looking for the dog. \n\nAfter this I made a apt with my PCP who also deemed I needed the rabies vaccine because rather safe then sorry. So when I arrive to the hospital the hospital staff told me they didn\u2019t think I was at that high or a risk to get the vaccine. Their reasoning was the county and country I live in hasn\u2019t seen a dog with rabies in several years. They also stated they often are over cautious with rabies. That the risk didn\u2019t out weigh the cost of the vaccine. \n\nSo who do I believe here? Do I actually need the vaccine? This has just left me as a ball of anxiety.\n\nEdit: I live in Austin Tx if that helps.\n\nEdit 2: I understand people are trying to help me by posting the symptoms of Rabies and how it works in the body. But those responses are just making me even more scared. I really just wanted to know who had the authority in this situation and who I should believe. Animal control and my PCP or the hospital staff who did look over the wound on my hand and listened to me explain the event. Thank you and I\u2019m sorry if I caused issues posting this here.\n\nEdit 3: So here are more details to help. The dog was not found so there\u2019s no way to quarantine and keep an eye on the dog. The finger that had the wound did go into the dogs mouth. So yes it came in contact with the saliva and yes it had been bleeding the day before. I had cut myself on a price of metal at work and it had been bleeding all day. It was not bleeding yesterday when I was bite but I don\u2019t know if it had been fully healed. It\u2019s on the crook of my finger so the top part still looked wet. If that makes sense.\n\n_Final Edit:_\n_So I took some of y\u2019all advice and I called my PCP. I explained to her everything that happened and what the two ER doctors told me and their concerns. She took all of that into consideration and she said she personally feels comfortable saying I don\u2019t need it. She was glad I talked to a doctor and then his supervisor at the ER about if I needed it. She said that they handle more cases each year about these things and that\u2019s why she sent me to them in the first place._\n\n_I am now going to go cry buckets of relief because I very much trust my PCP. For everyone who shared the statistics you are right it\u2019s highly unlikely. With this being said I\u2019m going to go ahead and call up my therapist because I think I have a severe anxiety disorder.

However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations.

    "question": "Hello all. \n\nI am a 30 F with breast cancer who is currently going through chemotherapy. I'm currently doing weekly taxols. I have 11 of them left. I heard that wearing cold gloves on the hands and feet can prevent peripheral neuropathy. However, I am troubled by the fact that these studies are relatively recent, so I don't know the longterm outcomes. Also, what if a cancer cell is hiding in my hands or feet and the chemo can't get to it? I asked my doctor about it via email and she said she's fine with icing. But she didn't really explain her reasoning in the email. \n\nHelp! \n\nWhat do you guys think?",
    "document": "The effectiveness of regional cooling for paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy\nBackground \n             There are currently no promising therapies available to treat or prevent peripheral neuropathy (PN) induced by anticancer drugs in a cumulative dose-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of regional cooling of hands and feet in preventing paclitaxel (PTX)-induced PN. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Patients with gynecologic cancer who received a tri-weekly cycle of chemotherapy including PTX at doses of 150\u2013175\u00a0mg/m 2  were included in this study. Regional cooling was performed by covering patient hands and feet with cold insulators during PTX administration (regional cooling group). The primary end-point was \u2265grade 2 PN evaluated by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. The secondary end-points were the frequency of PN therapeutic drug use, PTX dose reduction due to PN, and adverse events due to regional cooling. The efficacy of regional cooling was compared with data retrospectively extracted from the medical records of patients who did not receive regional cooling (control group). All end-points were evaluated for up to six cycles. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             There were 40 and 142 patients in the regional cooling and control groups, respectively. As a primary end-point, incidences of \u2265grade 2 PN in the fourth to sixth cycles were significantly lower than that in the cooling group (5.0\u20139.1\u00a0% vs. 19.8\u201331.6\u00a0%,  p \u2009<\u20090.05 after the fourth cycle and  p \u2009<\u20090.01 after the fifth cycle). Among secondary end-points, neither the use of PN therapeutic drugs nor the PTX dose reduction due to PN were significantly lower in the cooling group than in the control group (27.5 vs. 36.6\u00a0%,  p \u2009=\u20090.378 and 5.0 vs. 3.5\u00a0%,  p \u2009=\u20090.645, respectively). There were no serious regional cooling-associated adverse events such as frostbite. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Regional cooling of hands and feet during PTX administration might have good effectiveness and tolerability, suggesting this approach as a potentially effective supportive care to prevent PTX-induced PN. \n           \n           \n             Trial registration \n             The trial approval number in the institution; H25-26.

    "response": "The idea is that the ice causes those peripheral vessels to constrict and get less of the chemo running through your system. Those are highly unlikely metastatic sites so it should be fine. It's still fairly new procedure but was presented to me as best practice in my classes for managing some of these neurotoxic side effects."

    "document": "The Relationship between Vitamin D Status and the Menstrual Cycle in Young Women: A Preliminary Study\nBackground: The aim of this study was to evaluate serum vitamin D levels and to compare these with the menstrual cycle in young women with different body weights. Methods: Eighty-four students were recruited into the study of which 77 remained at the study\u2019s completion. Women were assigned to one of two subgroups, according to their 25-hydroxy vitamin D test level [25(OH)D] in which 60 women had low 25(OH)D levels (LD < 30 ng/mL) and 17 had normal levels (ND > 30 ng/mL \u2264 80 ng/mL). Results: In the LD group, 40% of participants reported having long cycles, 27% were classified as having oligomenorrhoea, and 13% as having amenorrhoea. In the ND group, only 12% reported menstrual cycle disorders, 6% had oligomenorrhoea, and 6% had amenorrhoea. Women who did not meet the recommended level of 30 ng/mL of 25(OH)D had almost five times the odds of having menstrual cycle disorders as women who were above the recommended vitamin D level. Conclusion: A relationship was demonstrated between the frequency of menstrual disorders and low levels of vitamin D. Supplementation is necessary in women with low levels of vitamin D in order to compensate for this deficiency and to assess its effect in regulating menstrual disorders.",

Gyno thinks it will be walled off by my body and cause no issues.** \n\nI've had a Paragard for 7 years, loved it. I noticed some BV symptoms during my September and October periods, which I'd read could be due to the IUD being infected. I figured, eh, I'm overdue for a pap anyways, let's just go get the IUD swapped out if it's infected.\n\nI get there, my gyno is great- very open and honest with me the whole time. He went in to get the pap and noted my IUD was hanging out. He said he could leave it, it would just be ineffective; I said eh, if it's not in there correctly, let's just swap it out for a new one to be properly placed. No harm no foul, right? As he removes it, he and the nurse both looked shocked, and told me it had broken into three pieces. Two very big ones, which they got out, but a third verrry small piece was still in there.\n\nThey tried valiantly to get it. We even did an ultrasound assist for it (ouch) for 15-20 minutes before they decided nope, it must be embedded.\n\nI went in for a hysteroscopy to have it removed, with the expectation that if they couldn't get it, they may do a laparascopy to get it if it was poking out the back. When I woke up, my gyno told me he just couldn't justify opening me up because the tiny piece just seemed to be gone. They even couldn't find it with an ultrasound. He sent me for an MRI just to be sure I hadn't expelled it.\n\nWelp, turns out, I didn't expel it- it's just totally embedded in the muscle of my uterus. Yay! He told me he did not feel comfortable opening me up and causing so much damage to the uterus to effectively hunt down something the size of a broken needle, and likened it to shrapnel from a bullet- he believes my body will wall it off and it won't move. But, he admitted he's also never seen this before and there's nothing in the textbooks for it. His colleagues he spoke to also believe it will be walled off and won't move, and I don't have to worry about it perforating totally. He did also say that he was very humbled by the entire experience and his lack of knowledge to give me a better answer, and wouldn't have his feelings hurt at all if I wanted another opinion.\n\nSince this is just such a tiny piece and not the entire IUD, has anyone run into a similar experience? Can I just leave it there and have it be fine? Or has anyone seen this cause complications down the road?",

    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions.

This can be affected by high or low iron or hemoglobin levels, or by vitamin levels, liver and thyroid function.

Your numbers are only slightly raised, which might mean you're either at the beginning of an infection, have a small infection somewhere, or recovering from infection.\n\nMean cell haemoglobin level - How much haemoglobin is in each red blood cell, on average. This can be caused by smoking. In the lungs, O2 and CO2 gets interchanged between the lungs and blood.

I faint and fall frequently, am always nauseated, experience total disorientation. I don\u2019t hear sounds coming from the correct places ( sounds are always opposite of where I think they are ), the room often spins or slides, I see stars and am unable to breathe a lot. When it\u2019s bad I forget how to speak, what things are, where I am, who I am, who the people around me are, and am totally unable to read. I get headaches in the back of my head. \n\nI have been to hundreds of doctors. I\u2019ve been out of state. I\u2019ve had every test imaginable. I\u2019ve tried alternative medicine, been rushed to the ER, done MRIs and CAT scans and EKGs and brain monitoring and gastroscopies and even a weird DNA mapping thing. Some dude even stuck a balloon up my nose. \n\nNo one has any idea, and many of my doctors thought I was faking it. I was once told I may have basilar migraine syndrome but there was nothing I could do about it. \n\nI missed a lot of school, and ended up dropping out of high school. I am unable to work at all because I have so little concentration or energy.\n\nWhen I was 20 I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. Late 2019 I was diagnosed with OCD, PTSD, and depression. A few months ago I started losing hearing in my left ear ( did MRIs, all normal, tried oral and injectable steroids, no difference ). Recently I learned my muscles are hurting WAY more than they should and are always super tense. I also just straight up don\u2019t get periods. Maybe once every like,,, six months. ( The rules said I had to mention everything, sorry if this is TMI. Doctors said I don\u2019t have PCOS. )\n\nBecause of a combination of arthritis and my dizziness, I can\u2019t walk. I have wheelchairs. I have to sit to even brush my teeth and wash my face. I can\u2019t make my own food or walk to get a glass of water. My entire life is relegated to my bed and my room and I am completely dependent on the help of my family. \n\nTo my question: do I give up trying to get medical help? Everyone says I\u2019m making it up and it isn\u2019t a huge deal, but this is Hell. I started trying a neurologist again but then COVID hit, and being in south Florida, it\u2019s even more unsafe.

    "document": "Biological relevance of ZNF224 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication IN NF-kB pathway regulation\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, whose presentation and clinical course are highly variable. Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",

    "document": "Incidence of Tendinopathy in Team Sports in a Multidisciplinary Sports Club Over 8 Seasons\nTendinopathy is a critical medical condition that often hinders level of participation for professional and young athletes in many sports. The purpose of the study was to describe the incidence and severity of tendinopathy in a multi-sport club with professional and youth teams. We performed a retrospective epidemiological study. Incidence of tendinopathy in players (n = 3839; 8-38 years, professional and youth) was reviewed over 8 seasons (2008-2016) in 5 team sports: football, basketball, handball, roller hockey, and futsal. Team physicians diagnosed and classified tendinopathies according to anatomical location, sport types, playing category, sex, playing surface, lost training time, and severity (time to return to play). Injuries were coded using OSICS-10, and incidence of tendinopathies were calculated as the number of injuries per 100 players per season. The total relative frequency of tendinopathy (versus total injuries) was 22% (843/3839) over 8 seasons from 360 in youth and 483 in professional teams. The incidence of injury was the highest in professional basketball [69.9, 95%CI: (58.0-81.4)] followed by professional roller hockey [64.4, 95%CI: (47.3-85.6)], and professional futsal [36.2, 95%CI: (27.3-47.1)]. The most incidences commonly affected tendons were the patellar [11.7, 95%CI: (10.0-13.5)] and Achilles [10.3, 95%CI: (8.5-12.5)]. Tendinopathies represent a significant number of injuries in team sports and are more common in professional than youth teams, especially basketball and roller hockey.

    "document": "Uncovering the CO2 Capture Mechanism of\nNaNO3-Promoted MgO by 18O Isotope Labeling\nMgO-based CO 2  sorbents promoted with molten\nalkali metal\nnitrates (e.g., NaNO 3 ) have emerged as promising materials\nfor CO 2  capture and storage technologies due to their low\ncost and high theoretical CO 2  uptake capacities. Yet, the\nmechanism by which molten alkali metal nitrates promote the carbonation\nof MgO (CO 2  capture reaction) remains debated and poorly\nunderstood. Here, we utilize  18 O isotope labeling experiments\nto provide new insights into the carbonation mechanism of NaNO 3 -promoted MgO sorbents, a system in which the promoter is\nmolten under operation conditions and hence inherently challenging\nto characterize. To conduct the  18 O isotope labeling experiments,\nwe report a facile and large-scale synthesis procedure to obtain labeled\nMgO with a high  18 O isotope content. We use Raman spectroscopy\nand  in situ  thermogravimetric analysis in combination\nwith mass spectrometry to track the  18 O label in the solid\n(MgCO 3 ), molten (NaNO 3 ), and gas (CO 2 ) phases during the CO 2  capture (carbonation) and regeneration\n(decarbonation) reactions. We discovered a rapid oxygen exchange between\nCO 2  and MgO through the reversible formation of surface\ncarbonates, independent of the presence of the promoter NaNO 3 . On the other hand, no oxygen exchange was observed between NaNO 3  and CO 2  or NaNO 3  and MgO. Combining\nthe results of the  18 O labeling experiments, with insights\ngained from atomistic calculations, we propose a carbonation mechanism\nthat, in the first stage, proceeds through a fast, surface-limited\ncarbonation of MgO. These surface carbonates are subsequently dissolved\nas [Mg 2+ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7CO 3 2\u2013 ] ionic pairs in the molten NaNO 3  promoter. Upon reaching\nthe solubility limit, MgCO 3  crystallizes at the MgO/NaNO 3  interface.",

    "document": "Managing Occupational Risks for Hepatitis C Transmission in the Health Care Setting\nHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a significant contemporary health problem in the United States and elsewhere. Because it is primarily transmitted via blood, hepatitis C infection presents risks for both nosocomial transmission to patients and occupational spread to health care workers. Recent insights into the pathogenesis, immunopathogenesis, natural history, and treatment of infection caused by this unique flavivirus provide a rationale for the use of new strategies for managing occupational hepatitis C infections when they occur. This article reviews this developing information. Recently published data demonstrate success rates in the treatment of \u201cacute hepatitis C syndrome\u201d that approach 100\\%, and although these studies are not directly applicable to all occupational infections, they may provide important clues to optimal management strategies. In addition, the article delineates approaches to the prevention of occupational exposures and also addresses the difficult issue of managing HCV-infected health care providers. The article summarizes currently available data about the nosocomial epidemiology of HCV infection and the magnitude of risk and discusses several alternatives for managing exposure and infection. No evidence supports the use of immediate postexposure prophylaxis with immunoglobulin, immunomodulators, or antiviral agents. Based on the very limited data available, the watchful waiting and preemptive therapy strategies described in detail in this article represent reasonable interim approaches to the complex problem of managing occupational HCV infections, at least until more definitive data are obtained.",

PPI overutilization in ambulatory care settings is often a result of failure to re-evaluate the need for continuation of therapy, or insufficient use of on-demand and step-down therapy. Nonjudicious use of PPIs creates both preventable financial as well as medical concerns. PPIs have been associated with an increased risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies impacting vitamin B 12 , vitamin C, calcium, iron and magnesium metabolism. While these risks are considered to be relatively low in the general population, they may be notable in elderly and malnourished patients, as well as those on chronic hemodialysis and concomitant PPI therapy.

This weekend in particular I did a lot, taking multiple hits off of a dab pen on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday night.  Each time I woke up the next morning I felt fine, until Tuesday morning.  I thought I was still high because I was still hallucinating, but the hallucinations persisted all day.  Then I woke up today and the hallucinations persisted yet again.  I\u2019m only experiencing one type of hallucination, which is the same type I got while being high.  My vision turns into what I would call a slideshow when I see something moving, particularly elevator doors or automatic doors or cars passing by.  Obviously this is very concerning, and it is very disruptive to my daily life.  Tonight I went to bed around about 3 hours ago and I felt panic setting in and my mind started to race with scary thoughts.  I haven\u2019t been able to sleep at all.  I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind and I need to talk to someone.  Do you think this is a serious issue, or will it pass with time?  Do I need to see a doctor?  Thanks for all of your help.\n\nEdit:  Thanks everyone for the overwhelming amount of responses and advice!!  You\u2019ve convinced me that I don\u2019t have schizophrenia, but it definitely sounds like I have drug-induced psychosis.  I will not be smoking anytime soon, and I\u2019ll stay away from alcohol until these symptoms go away.  Thanks again for everything, I appreciate all the responses!",
    "document": "The Association Between Cannabis Use and Schizophrenia: Causative or Curative? A Systematic Review\nMarijuana is one of the most abused substances in the world. Marijuana is getting legalized around the world. So, it is crucial to understand its effect on our mental health. Its impact on the schizophrenia spectrum needs our special attention. Even though marijuana has been around for a long time, its exact effects are still unknown. Schizophrenia is a chronic illness affecting approximately 20 million people worldwide. Schizophrenia and cannabis seem to have a close relationship, and we want to explore this. We want to know if marijuana is causing, exacerbating, or treating schizophrenia. This systematic review explores this question. We searched online resources like PubMed, PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar for systematic reviews, traditional reviews, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analysis on cannabis and schizophrenia/ psychosis. We included human studies published in peer-reviewed journals in the English language in the last five years. After reviewing 96 initial results of our search, we excluded 25 duplicates, 29 abstracts, and 18 irrelevant articles. We did a quality assessment for the remaining 24 studies using various quality assessment tools. After the quality assessment, we found 12 articles were of low quality and excluded those. We included the remaining 12 final studies in our systematic review. Out of these 12 studies, five were traditional reviews, two systematic reviews, two meta-analysis, and three observational studies. Six of the articles were on cannabis\u2019s effect on just schizophrenia or psychotic disorder. The other six included schizophrenia plus other psychiatric or neurological illnesses. Ten of the studies had data supporting the causative link between cannabis and schizophrenia. Eight records had data supporting the exacerbating effect of marijuana. Six studies had data supporting the therapeutic effect of the cannabidiol (CBD) component of cannabis. From the current data, we can conclude that the tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) component of cannabis can be the main culprit causing psychosis and schizophrenia in the at-risk population. THC can also be the one exacerbating symptoms and causing an adverse prognosis in already diagnosed patients. Even though CBD shows therapeutic effects and THC opposing effects, the data is minimal and low safety and efficacy warrants more research. The relation between cannabis and schizophrenia needs further investigation. We need more case-control studies and clinical trials with a larger population to get conclusive data.",
    "response": "This is likely substance-induced psychosis. Marihuana is very well known for causing psychosis, especially in people that might have a predisposition to it. In most cases of substance-induced psychosis, the psychosis should go away with time once you shop using marijuana and you should be fine after that. I would strongly recommended stopping marijuana altogether. It seems like this is causing you a lot of distress so I would also recommend you seek your doctors help to guide you through this."

Urgent Care Docs had advised me that any escalation of symptoms should mean I go to the Emergency Room. Once there they almost immediately checked me into the ICU for observation and began running every test you could name. For the next 4/5 days I did just an unreal number of scans, 2 biopsies, and they drew enough blood to fill a small pool. Pain escalated daily while there so finding a solution was a running theme. So after a lot of trails here's what they found:\n\nCurrent: Stage 4 Aggressive Metastatic Gastrointestinal Cancer ( Adenocarcinoma )\n\nPrevious: Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation \n\nAfter doing a Lymph Node & Bone Marrow Biopsy they found my marrow filled to capacity with dead cancer cells. This pointed them in the right direction. My platelets were crashing daily (20,000 at admission) and I've got inflamed lymph nodes throughout my chest cavity which is one source of my (significant and at time escalating) pain. Its infiltrated my lungs and several vertebrae along my spine (causing vertebrae to show signs of Osteopenia) . Weirdly enough there's no noticeable tumor/mass/lump they can trace it back to. It's kind of just spread throughout (described as Adenocarcinoma) , though they were finally able to locate a small ulcer in my stomach that allowed them to finally be able to classify it. I've currently just completed my 3rd (now weekly) round of chemo (we started asap when other options such as clinical trials were deemed a non-option) and we've been able to stabilize a number of things (blood factors such as platelets, hemoglobin and the like) along the way. Many of my blood counts are still in the trash so clinical trails are not currently an option. In early stages of my 3 weeks hospital visit I was in a state called **DIC (**Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) which caused me to act like something akin to a blood squirt gun if i bled. Essentialy it screws with you clotting factors and any bleeding event is an issue. Any procedure became an issue and many my numbers were artifically raised in order to attempt anything that would cause me to bleed. Fortunately after a week of treatments and what felt like several wheel barrows of infusions we kicked my body out of D.I.C and am more or less clotting normally. Fun story: early one morning after the vampires took their daily does of my blood a CNA came in to do a routine vitals check. This particular morning they took 2 unique sets of blood samples plus a rather large sample for testing against infectious disease. This was also kind of at the height of my \"he's not clotting\" phase. During the blood pressure check it popped open all the fresh holes in my arm, causing them to bleed and freaked/surprised the CNA. Made me laugh. (end of story).  Immunotherapy is what my Oncologist are banking on right now so crossing my fingers. Chemo is causing reasonable progress (numbers are low but stable) so we're staying the course for now. My personal mid->long term goal is to find an alternative to opiates for pain management (who the hell knows why a person tolerates opiates for a buzz cause constipation sucks!!!) so looking at alternatives (THC pills potentially or preferably resolving the issue that's causing me pain)  I've been discharged from the hospital after 3 weeks so now I'm working to find a routine that works. Losing weight so a short term goal is stopping that (I'm rather tall and (was) muscular so my bodies nuking whatever calories I put in and I'm not putting in a lot due to general nausea, but smoothies have been my friend. Please let me know if you have any questions or advice.. I'll answer what I can and absorb what reasonable advice I read.",
    "document": "Cannabinoids as novel anti-inflammatory drugs\nCannabinoids are a group of compounds that mediate their effects through cannabinoid receptors. The discovery of \u0394 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as the major psychoactive principle in marijuana, as well as the identification of cannabinoid receptors and their endogenous ligands, has led to a significant growth in research aimed at understanding the physiological functions of cannabinoids. Cannabinoid receptors include CB1, which is predominantly expressed in the brain, and CB2, which is primarily found on the cells of the immune system. The fact that both CB1 and CB2 receptors have been found on immune cells suggests that cannabinoids play an important role in the regulation of the immune system. Recent studies demonstrated that administration of THC into mice triggered marked apoptosis in T cells and dendritic cells, resulting in immunosuppression. In addition, several studies showed that cannabinoids downregulate cytokine and chemokine production and, in some models, upregulate T-regulatory cells (Tregs) as a mechanism to suppress inflammatory responses. The endocannabinoid system is also involved in immunoregulation. For example, administration of endocannabinoids or use of inhibitors of enzymes that break down the endocannabinoids, led to immunosuppression and recovery from immune-mediated injury to organs such as the liver. Manipulation of endocannabinoids and/or use of exogenous cannabinoids  in vivo  can constitute a potent treatment modality against inflammatory disorders. This review will focus on the potential use of cannabinoids as a new class of anti-inflammatory agents against a number of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that are primarily triggered by activated T cells or other cellular immune components.",

    "document": "Culture and identification of\nBorrelia spirochetes in human vaginal and seminal secretions\nBackground:  Recent reports indicate that more than 300,000 cases of Lyme disease are diagnosed yearly in the USA. Preliminary clinical, epidemiological and immunological studies suggest that infection with the Lyme disease spirochete\n Borrelia burgdorferi  (Bb) could be transferred from person to person via intimate human contact without a tick vector. Failure to detect viable\n Borrelia  spirochetes in vaginal and seminal secretions would argue against this hypothesis. \n           Methods:  Patients with and without a history of Lyme disease were selected for the study after informed consent was obtained. Serological testing for Bb was performed on all subjects. Semen or vaginal secretions were inoculated into BSK-H medium and cultured for four weeks. Examination of genital cultures and culture concentrates for the presence of spirochetes was performed using light and darkfield microscopy, and spirochete concentrates were subjected to Dieterle silver staining, anti-Bb immunohistochemical staining, molecular hybridization and PCR analysis for further characterization. Immunohistochemical and molecular testing was performed in three independent laboratories in a blinded fashion. Positive and negative controls were included in all experiments. \n           Results:  Control subjects who were asymptomatic and seronegative for Bb had no detectable spirochetes in genital secretions by PCR analysis. In contrast, spirochetes were observed in cultures of genital secretions from 11 of 13 subjects diagnosed with Lyme disease, and motile spirochetes were detected in genital culture concentrates from 12 of 13 Lyme disease patients using light and darkfield microscopy. Morphological features of spirochetes were confirmed by Dieterle silver staining and immunohistochemical staining of culture concentrates. Molecular hybridization and PCR testing confirmed that the spirochetes isolated from semen and vaginal secretions were strains of\n Borrelia , and all cultures were negative for treponemal spirochetes. PCR sequencing of cultured spirochetes from three couples having unprotected sex indicated that two couples had identical strains of Bb\n sensu stricto  in their semen and vaginal secretions, while the third couple had identical strains of\n B. hermsii  detected in their genital secretions. \n           Conclusions:  The culture of viable\n Borrelia  spirochetes in genital secretions suggests that Lyme disease could be transmitted by intimate contact from person to person. Further studies are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.",

    "document": "Relevance of Mitochondrial Genetics and Metabolism in Cancer Development\nCancer cells are characterized in general by a decrease of mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, together with a strong enhancement of glycolysis, the so-called Warburg effect. The decrease of mitochondrial activity in cancer cells may have multiple reasons, related either to the input of reducing equivalents to the electron transfer chain or to direct alterations of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes. In some cases, the depression of respiratory activity is clearly the consequence of disruptive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and leads as a consequence to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). By acting both as mutagens and cellular mitogens, ROS may contribute directly to cancer progression. On the basis of our experimental evidence, we suggest a deep implication of the supercomplex organization of the respiratory chain as a missing link between oxidative stress, energy failure, and tumorigenesis. We speculate that under conditions of oxidative stress, a dissociation of mitochondrial supercomplexes occurs, with destabilization of complex I and secondary enhanced generation of ROS, thus leading to a vicious circle amplifying mitochondrial dysfunction. An excellent model to dissect the role of pathogenic, disassembling mtDNA mutations in tumor progression and their contribution to the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells (glycolysis vs. respiration) is provided by an often underdiagnosed subset of tumors, namely, the oncocytomas, characterized by disruptive mutations of mtDNA, especially of complex I subunits. Such mutations almost completely abolish complex I activity, which slows down the Krebs cycle, favoring a high ratio of \u03b1-ketoglutarate/succinate and consequent destabilization of hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). On the other hand, if complex I is partially defective, the levels of NAD +  may be sufficient to implement the Krebs cycle with higher levels of intermediates that stabilize HIF1\u03b1, thus favoring tumor malignancy. The threshold model we propose, based on the population-like dynamics of mitochondrial genetics (heteroplasmy vs. homoplasmy), implies that below threshold complex I is present and functioning correctly, thus favoring tumor growth, whereas above threshold, when complex I is not assembled, tumor growth is arrested. We have therefore termed \u201concojanus\u201d the mtDNA genes whose disruptive mutations have such a double-edged effect. \n        \n           During oncogenesis, mitochondrial mutations and exogenous factors (e.g., hypoxia) induce oxidative stress. This may lead to the disorganization of mitochondrial supercomplexes, amplifying mitochondrial dysfunction.",

    "document": "A Pot Ignored Boils On: Sustained Calls for Explicit Consent of Intimate Medical Exams\nUnconsented intimate exams (UIEs) on men and women are known to occur for training purposes and diagnostic reasons, mostly during gynecological surgeries but also during prostate examinations and abdominal surgeries. UIEs most often occur on anesthetized patients but have also been reported on conscious patients. Over the last 30\u00a0years, several parties\u2014both within and external to medicine\u2014have increasingly voiced opposition to these exams. Arguments from medical associations, legal scholars, ethicists, nurses, and some physicians have not compelled meaningful institutional change. Opposition is escalating in the form of legislative bans and whistleblower reports. Aspiring to professional and scientific detachment, institutional consent policies make no distinction between intimate exams and exams on any other body part, but patients do not think of their intimate regions in a detached or neutral way and believe intimate exams call for special protections. UIEs are found to contribute to moral erosion and moral distress of medical students and compromise the sacred trust between the medical community and the general public. This paper refutes the main arguments in favor of the status quo, identifies a series of harms related to continuing the current practice, and proposes an explicit consent policy for intimate exams along with specific changes to medical school curriculum and institutional culture. Because patients are the rights-holders of their bodies, consent practices should reflect and uphold patient values which call for explicit consent for intimate exams.",
    "response": "I started medical school about 9 years ago. I only ever did sensitive exams on awake, consenting patients. Never did one or was asked to do one on a patient who was asleep or under anesthesia. When a patient requires an exam under anesthesia, they will generally be specifically consented for this exam. Whether or not that consent always specifically states that there may be a medical student involved in the exam, I am not sure.\n\nIn general, if you get care at a teaching institution, you will have medical students and residents involved in your care. As a physician and as a patient (recent cancer survivor), I very strongly feel that medical students and residents *need* to be involved in patient care in a hands-on and meaningful way. However, patients also must be fully informed of this before receiving care."

She was prone to fainting, migraines, infections etc. A few years ago her health declined much more rapidly and it was found she had Lyme disease and probably had had it for about 10 years.

She's really putting her body through the ringer. \n\nAt this point I do believe she probably had some post Lyme disease treatment syndrome, and is probably still suffering from CFS/fibromyalgia or something, but every new thing she does to her body I worry is setting her healing back further.

    "document": "Potential Patient-Reported Toxicities With Disulfiram Treatment in Late Disseminated Lyme Disease\nRecently, disulfiram has been proposed as a promising treatment for people suffering from persistent symptoms of Lyme Disease. Disulfiram has several distinct molecular targets. The most well-known is alcohol dehydrogenase, a key enzyme for detoxifying the organism after alcohol ingestion. Other targets and modes of action of disulfiram, that may present problematic side effects, are less commonly mentioned. The  French Federation against Tick Borne Diseases  (French acronym, FFMVT), which associates three main Lyme patient organizations, MDs and PhDs, has recently been alerted to severe and persistent toxic events in a patient suffering from a late disseminated form of Lyme Disease following disulfiram intake. FFMVT reacted by launching a national call to examine whether other patients in France following a similar treatment could be identified, and what benefits, or side effects could be reported. The statements of 16 patients taking disulfiram have been collected and are presented here. Thirteen out of 16 patients reported toxic events, and seven out of 16 reported benefits for at least part of their symptoms. Based on the collected observations, it seems too early to promote disulfiram as a promising new treatment until the reasons underlying the reported toxicities have been explored, and the results of a well-conducted double blind clinical trial published. The importance of taking into account patient-reported outcomes in Lyme Disease is underlined by the present study.",

The next day after the party I felt a lot of weird pressure under my rib cage and I was having difficulty taking a deep breath.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went to the doctor straight away and she suspected pancreatitis.

    "document": "Chronic PPI Therapy and Calcium Metabolism\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been widely used since their introduction in the late 1980s because they are highly effective for acid-related conditions. However, some recent epidemiological studies have suggested a positive association between PPI therapy and the risk of osteoporotic fractures. The potential mechanisms underlying this association may be related to the physiologic effects of chronic acid suppression on calcium metabolism. First, chronic hypergastrinemia induced by PPI therapy may lead to parathyroid hyperplasia, resulting in increased loss of calcium from the bone. Second, profound gastric acid suppression may reduce the bioavailability of calcium for intestinal absorption. I will review the published evidence regarding these potential links and discuss their clinical implications.",

    "document": "Anesthetic Requirement is Increased in Redheads\nBackground:  Age and body temperature alter inhalational anesthetic requirement; however, no human genotype is associated with inhalational anesthetic requirement. There is an anecdotal impression that anesthetic requirement is increased in redheads. Furthermore, red hair results from distinct mutations of the melanocortin-1 receptor. We thus tested the hypothesis that the requirement for the volatile anesthetic desflurane is greater in natural redhead than in dark-haired women. \n           Methods:  We studied healthy women with bright red (n=10) or dark (n=10) hair. Blood was sampled for subsequent analyses of melanocortin-1 receptor alleles. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and maintained with desflurane randomly set at an end-tidal concentration between 5.5 and 7.5%. After an equilibration period, a noxious electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 70 mA) was transmitted through bilateral intradermal needles. If the volunteer moved in response to stimulation, desflurane was increased by 0.5%; otherwise it was decreased by 0.5%. This was continued until volunteers \u201ccrossed-over\u201d from movement to non-movement (or vice versa) four times. Individual logistic regression curves were used to determine desflurane requirement (P 50 ). Desflurane requirements in the two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney nonparametric two-sample test;  P  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n           Results : The desflurane requirement in redheads (6.2 volume-percent [95% CI, 5.9 - 6.5]) was significantly greater than in dark-haired women (5.2 volume-percent [4.9 \u2013 5.5],  P  = 0.0004). Nine of 10 redheads were either homozygous or compound heterozygotes for mutations on the melanocortin-1 receptor gene. \n           Conclusions : Red hair appears to be a distinct phenotype linked to anesthetic requirement in humans that can also be traced to a specific genotype.",

If a polyp comes back with this on a slide, its a good indication that its an inflammatory polyp or pseudopolyp, which usually forms as a response to long-term inflammation. \n\n2) normal tissue. Nothing to see here. \n\n3 + 4) the same thing as #1, PLUS: aggregates of eosinophils, another type of white blood cell. They're usually present, but groups of them are indicative of an inflammatory process. \n\nWhat they're saying is: it's inflammation. (very specific, i know).\n\n- none of the polyps are cancerous or show any sort of weird growth pattern (the good news!)\n\n- eosinophils commonly respond to parasitic infection, but their presence doesnt mean there definitely is one- they didnt see parasitic organisms on the slides, but it cant be ruled out either, her doctor may ask her to provide a stool sample so they can test for microorganisms (also bacteria, viruses, yeast, etc) if they haven't already. \n\n- none of the slides show evidence of active colitis (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis) so if there wasnt an indication of either on the colonoscopy (visually) its less likely to be those. \n\n- there's nothing definitively diagnostic on the slides but they ruled out cancer. So the next course of action would be to take their findings and compare them to the microbiology (stool samples, swabs, etc for bacteria, viruses, fungi) and clinical (her symptoms over time, response to certain medications, etc). It could be autoimmune, allergic, or infectious. \n\nOn a more personal note, I hope your wife gets some answers soon. I was diagnosed with microscopic colitis on a colonoscopy at age 28, so I know what it's like to be dealing with those symptoms and it's pretty awful. Make sure she stays hydrated! Best of luck."

    "document": "\u201cThe Mediterranean Diet, its Components, and Cardiovascular Disease\u201d\nOne of the best studied diets for cardiovascular health is the Mediterranean diet. This consists of fish, monounsaturated fats from olive oil, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes/nuts, and moderate alcohol consumption. The Mediterranean diet has been shown to reduce the burden, or even prevent the development, of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, depression, colorectal cancer, diabetes, obesity, asthma, erectile dysfunction, and cognitive decline. This diet is also known to improve surrogates of cardiovascular disease, such as waist-to-hip ratio, lipids, and markers of inflammation, as well as primary cardiovascular disease outcomes such as death and events in both observational and randomized controlled trial data. These enhancements easily rival those seen with more established tools used to fight cardiovascular disease such as aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors, and exercise. However, it is unclear if the Mediterranean diet offers cardiovascular disease benefit from its individual constituents or in aggregate. Furthermore, the potential benefit of the Mediterranean diet or its components is not yet validated by concrete cardiovascular disease endpoints in randomized trials or observational studies. This review will focus on the effects of the whole and parts of the Mediterranean diet with regard to both population-based as well as experimental data highlighting cardiovascular disease morbidity or mortality and cardiovascular disease surrogates when hard outcomes are not available. Our synthesis will highlight the potential for the Mediterranean diet to act as a key player in cardiovascular disease prevention, and attempt to identify certain aspects of the diet which are particularly beneficial for cardio-protection.",

[Article here.]( While it\u2019s less invasive than an EBP, it\u2019s a bit more time consuming. I\u2019ve had lots of success with them. I use 3cc total (1.5cc each side) of 4% lidocaine on the long wooden handled cotton tips, incrementally dosing by dropping down the handle and leaving them in place 20 min. An SPG block would be my first suggestion for his next PDPH! It\u2019s a very low risk, high reward procedure. And if it doesn\u2019t work, he can always try a second SPG block or go to an EBP if desired."

    "question": "Hi there,\n\nI've been dating a girl for a little over a week and last night was the first time she came back to my place, she is only my second sexual partner. She was kind enough to let me know before we did anything that she had HPV. I didn't know ANYTHING about HPV and she started explaining some things to me.\n\nWe did not have vaginal intercourse - I received oral sex, and touched her vagina. She was under the impression that it was only genital to genital contact where the virus could spread which I now know she was mistaken. That was basically it - our genitals did not touch/I don't recall touching my own penis after having contact with her vagina,\n\nFor further information she had a colposcopy a couple weeks ago that did not show any abnormal cells - but when she went back for a PAP smear they potential showed evidence of low grade cells.\n\nPlease forgive my naivity but how likely is it that I have contracted HPV? I would like to know if I need to warn future sexual partners? I'm a little spooked.",
    "document": "Genital Transmission of Human Papillomavirus in Recently Formed Heterosexual Couples\nWe estimated human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission rates among persons with documented sexual exposure to an infected partner. Recently formed couples enrolled in the HITCH Study (HPV Infection and Transmission among Couples through Heterosexual activity) in Montreal, Canada, and provided genital specimens for DNA testing of 36 HPV genotypes. At enrollment, 179 couples were discordant for \u22651 HPV types; transmission was observed at follow-up in 73 partnerships. There was little difference between the male-to-female (3.5 per 100 person-months, 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7\u20134.5) and female-to-male (4.0 per 100 person-months, 95% CI, 3.0\u20135.5) transmission rates. Rates did not vary with the lifetime number of partners reported by the initially uninfected partner, providing no evidence of reduced susceptibility for those with extensive sexual histories. Transmission was also relatively homogeneous across HPV genotypes and alpha species and oncogenic risk categories. The findings contribute to a small but growing evidence base regarding the natural history of HPV transmission.",
    "response": ">Please forgive my naivity but how likely is it that I have contracted HPV?\n\nFrom a single \"exposure\" that wasn't really even an exposure? Well below 1%.

    "document": "Preterm Birth: Long Term Cardiovascular and Renal Consequences\nBackground:  \n              Cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases are a part of non-communicable chronic diseases, the leading causes of premature death worldwide. They are recognized as having early origins through altered developmental programming, due to adverse environmental conditions during development. Preterm birth is such an adverse factor. Rates of preterm birth increased in the last decades, however, with the improvement in perinatal and neonatal care, a growing number of preterm born subjects has now entered adulthood. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that preterm birth is associated with impaired or arrested structural or functional development of key or-gans/systems making preterm infants vulnerable to cardiovascular and chronic renal diseases at adult-hood. This review analyzes the evidence of such cardiovascular and renal changes, the role of perina-tal and neonatal factors such as antenatal steroids and potential pathogenic mechanisms, including de-velopmental programming and epigenetic alterations. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion:  \n              Preterm born subjects are exposed to a significantly increased risk for altered cardio-vascular and renal functions at young adulthood. Adequate, specific follow-up measures remain to be determined. While antenatal steroids have considerably improved preterm birth outcomes, repeated therapy should be considered with caution, as antenatal steroids induce long-term cardio-vascular and metabolic alterations in animals\u2019 models and their involvement in the accelerated cellular senescence observed in human studies cannot be excluded.",

    "document": "Outcomes for Extremely Premature Infants\nPremature birth is a significant cause of infant and child morbidity and mortality. In the United States, the premature birth rate, which had steadily increased during the 1990s and early 2000s, has decreased annually for four years and is now approximately 11.5%. Human viability, defined as gestational age at which the chance of survival is 50%, is currently approximately 23\u201324 weeks in developed countries. Infant girls, on average, have better outcomes than infant boys. A relatively uncomplicated course in the intensive care nursery for an extremely premature infant results in a discharge date close to the prenatal EDC. Despite technological advances and efforts of child health experts during the last generation, the extremely premature infant (less than 28 weeks gestation) and extremely low birth weight infant (ELBW) (< 1000 grams) remain at high risk for death and disability with 30\u201350% mortality and, in survivors, at least 20\u201350% risk of morbidity. The introduction of CPAP, mechanical ventilation, and exogenous surfactant increased survival and spurred the development of neonatal intensive care in the 1970s through the early 1990s. Routine administration of antenatal steroids during premature labor improved neonatal mortality and morbidity in the late 1990s. The recognition that chronic postnatal administration of steroids to infants should be avoided may have improved outcomes in the early 2000s. Evidence from recent trials attempting to define the appropriate target for oxygen saturation in preterm infants suggests arterial oxygen saturation between 91\u201395% (compared to 85\u201389%) avoids excess mortality. However, final analyses of data from these trials have not been published, so definitive recommendations are still pending The development of neonatal neurocognitive care visits may improve neurocognitive outcomes in this high-risk group. Long-term follow up to detect and address developmental, learning, behavioral, and social problems is critical for children born at these early gestational ages. \n           The striking similarities in response to extreme prematurity in the lung and brain imply that agents and techniques that benefit one organ are likely to also benefit the other. Finally, since therapy and supportive care continue to change, the outcomes of ELBW infants are ever evolving. Efforts to minimize injury, preserve growth, and identify interventions focused on antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways are now being evaluated. Thus, treating and preventing long-term deficits must be developed in the context of a \u201cmoving target.\u201d",

A free text search of keywords including fractional resurfacing, nonablative lasers, skin type, skin of color, ethnic skin, Fitzpatrick skin type, Asian skin, African Americans, Afro-Caribbean, and Hispanics was also executed. An in-depth review of all the relevant articles fitting the authors\u2019 inclusion/exclusion criteria was performed. Thereafter, each study was assigned levels of evidence per the Modified Criteria by Oxford Center of Evidence Based Medicine. A recommendation was made for a specific treatment based on the presence of at least one Level 1 study or more than three Level 2 or 3 studies that had concordant results. \n           Findings:  The available evidence strongly suggests that fractional lasers are a favorable treatment option for a variety of dermatological diseases in Fitzpatrick skin phototypes IV to VI. Level 1 evidence was found for the use of fractional lasers for treating acne, striae and skin rejuvenation. Level 2 evidence was found for their use in acne scars, melasma, and surgical/traumatic scars. \n           Conclusion:  Fractional resurfacing is a safe and efficacious treatment option for various dermatological disorders in darker skin types; however, there is a paucity of high-quality studies involving skin types V and VI.",

Furthermore, we review a breadth of literature to gain an insight into how and why topical silicone gels remain the favored treatment of medical experts in scar management. We also analyze an ever increasing number of alternative therapies claiming to provide enhanced scar reduction performance. \n           Recent Advances:  Topical silicone gel treatments seem to remain the first point of clinical recommendation in scar management. SGS has been used in scar therapy for over 30 years, during which its efficacy has been the subject of numerous clinical evaluations. \n           Critical Issues:  While the exact mechanisms by which SGS improves hypertrophic scars, keloid development and recovery are yet to be fully agreed upon, its ability to do so remains largely undisputed at present. However, there still is ongoing deliberation over the exact mechanism of action of silicone in improving a scar. At present it is likely that through occlusion of the scar site and hydration of the wound bed, the overactivity of scar-related cells is suppressed, and their activity normalized. \n           Future Direction:  The clinical support of topical silicone gel products, relative to all alternative scar therapies, is considered the internationally recommended first-line form of scar management, and favored by consensus among healthcare professionals. However, there still remains the need for further clinical evidence and a better understanding of the mechanism behind the benefit of silicone gel for use in the prevention of abnormal scarring.",

In contrast to other recently described G protein-coupled tyrosine kinase pathways, the G\u03b1 o -mediated modulation requires neither protein kinase C nor intracellular Ca 2+ .

    "document": "Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome\nCoinciding with the increasing rates of cannabis abuse has been the recognition of a new clinical condition known as Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is characterized by chronic cannabis use, cyclic episodes of nausea and vomiting, and frequent hot bathing. Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome occurs by an unknown mechanism. Despite the well-established anti-emetic properties of marijuana, there is increasing evidence of its paradoxical effects on the gastrointestinal tract and CNS. Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabigerol are three cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant with opposing effects on the emesis response. The clinical course of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome may be divided into three phases: prodromal, hyperemetic, and recovery phase. The hyperemetic phase usually ceases within 48 hours, and treatment involves supportive therapy with fluid resuscitation and anti-emetic medications. Patients often demonstrate the learned behavior of frequent hot bathing, which produces temporary cessation of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The broad differential diagnosis of nausea and vomiting often leads to delay in the diagnosis of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome shares several similarities with CHS and the two conditions are often confused. Knowledge of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and natural course of Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome is limited and requires further investigation.",

Two review authors sifted for studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted and certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach and additionally in trial sequential analyses for mortality. Twenty-four randomized controlled trials involving 3406 participants met review inclusion. \n           \n           \n             Therapeutic Advances: \n             Meta-analysis of 15 trials found that ivermectin reduced risk of death compared with no ivermectin (average risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.19\u20130.73; n = 2438; I 2  = 49%; moderate-certainty evidence). This result was confirmed in a trial sequential analysis using the same DerSimonian\u2013Laird method that underpinned the unadjusted analysis. This was also robust against a trial sequential analysis using the Biggerstaff\u2013Tweedie method. Low-certainty evidence found that ivermectin prophylaxis reduced COVID-19 infection by an average 86% (95% confidence interval 79%\u201391%). Secondary outcomes provided less certain evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggested that there may be no benefit with ivermectin for \u201cneed for mechanical ventilation,\u201d whereas effect estimates for \u201cimprovement\u201d and \u201cdeterioration\u201d clearly favored ivermectin use.

    "document": "Biochemical Testing of the Thyroid: TSH is the Best and, Oftentimes, Only Test Needed \u2013 A Review for Primary Care\nDisorders of thyroid function are common, and screening, diagnosis, and management are often performed by primary care providers. While management of significant biochemical abnormalities is reasonably straight forward, laboratory tests only slightly outside, or even within, the normal range are becoming more difficult to appropriately manage. A large part of this increasing difficulty in appropriate management is caused by patients requesting, and even demanding, certain tests or treatments that may not be indicated. Symptoms of thyroid dysfunction are non-specific and extremely prevalent in the general population. This, along with a growing body of information available to patients via the lay press and internet suggesting that traditional thyroid function testing is not reliable, has fostered some degree of patient mistrust. Increasingly, when a physician informs a patient that their thyroid is not the cause of their symptoms, the patient is dissatisfied and even angry. This review aims to clarify the interpretation of normal and mild abnormalities of thyroid function tests by describing pituitary-thyroid physiology and through an in depth review of, arguably, the three most important biochemical tests of thyroid function: TSH, free T4, and anti-TPO antibodies. It is important for primary care providers to have an understanding of the shortcomings and proper interpretation of these tests to be better able to discuss thyroid function with their patients.",

You could discuss more detailed testing of T3/T4 for the rare case of secondary hypothyroidism where it's failure of TSH to appropriately respond that's the problem, but I would be very surprised.\n\nNDs are not medical practitioners; to be blunt, they practice quackery.

    "question": "**Summary**\n\nI experience extremely painful, tingling, burning, itchy skin almost almost everyday.\n\n**General**\n\nGender: F\n\nWeight: 105 lbs\n\nHeight: 5\u20192\u201d\n\nAge 37\n\n**Sensation**\n\nIt feels like fire ant bites (to which I am deathly allergic) all over my entire body. It\u2019s a tingling burning itching sensation. It feels like when your foot falls asleep but it\u2019s over my entire body and it hurts to touch it.\n\n**Appearance**\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be visible to hurt a lot but when it\u2019s been going for a while then I develop a red rash and hives that can be hard to get rid of.\n\n**Frequency**\n\nAlmost every day. The pain level ranges from a 5-7 on an average day. On a bad day, which is 1-2 days a week, the pain level is an 8-9 making it hard to move around or focus on anything. Sometimes I am lucky to have a low pain day 1-4 about once a week. I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a 0 pain day.\n\n**Triggers**\n\nI want to say everything triggers it because it happens nearly every day, but there are some things that certainly trigger it more than others.\n\nFor example, I know for sure that alcohol and stress have a direct effect, so I assume inflammation plays a part. I do experience a lot of stress but I\u2019ve pretty much given up alcohol completely.\n\nI suspect that sugar and inflammatory foods may contribute as well. I\u2019ve done diets that focus on whole foods and anti-inflammatory foods, which led to some improvement, like an average dropping of 1 point per day on the pain scale, but it\u2019s hard to continue such strict diets when the improvement in pain is so little.\n\n**Medications**\n\nI take Zyrtec D almost every day and a Benedryl about every other night. These take the burning and itching sensations away but do absolutely nothing for the pain.\n\nSometimes when the hives refuse to go away I take a steroid for five days. This does nothing for the pain but helps the appearance. Topical steroids seem to have no effect.\n\n**Other Medications**\n\nI have been taking a low dose of the generic version of Ativan for anxiety as of about 8 months ago. However, it hasn\u2019t really affected my skin condition much (though it has helped with anxiety).\n\nI am on birth control (desogestrel-ethinyl estradiol).\n\nI just started taking a daily vitamin.\n\n**History**\n\nI got really sick with influenza in my early twenties and I\u2019ve experienced this skin problem and pain consistently since then. I had zero skin problems before getting sick.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a dermatologist once but she didn\u2019t really know what it was and just called it \u201chives\u201d and said I should take allergy medicine\u2026 but I am taking allergy medicine already every single day.\n\nI also had blood work done - several tubes - and they didn\u2019t find anything. This was years ago so I don\u2019t remember the details well. The only thing I remember them finding was that my cortisol levels were high.  \n\n\nUPDATE 8/7/21 for those who may have similar troubles\n\nThere were two parts to my experience -- pain and itch.\n\nThe PAIN part has been almost completely removed by a special kind of Botox on the head. It's a once or twice a year thing. It was $2,000 and my particular insurance didn't cover it. But it was completely worth it. 50% of my symptoms just dissappeared in a matter of hours. The nerve pain / tingling only returns on extremely stressful days. Topical lydocain helps a little bit.\n\nI could NOT get rid of the intense ITCH which comes and goes, but the following have helped: reducing life stressors, taking a Zyrtec D, alternating hot and cold showers, and an anti-inflammatory diet (especially avoiding alcohol).\n\nI have NOT yet tried gabapentin or lyrica.",
    "document": "Neuropathic Itch\nChronic itch can be caused by dysfunctions of itch-sensing neurons that produce sensory hallucinations of pruritogenic stimuli. The cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unknown. All neurological disease categories have been implicated and neurological causes should be considered for patients with otherwise-unexplained itch. The same neurological illnesses that cause neuropathic pain can also or instead cause itch. These include shingles (particularly of the head or neck), small-fiber polyneuropathies, radiculopathies (e.g., notalgia paresthetica and brachioradial pruritis) and diverse lesions of the trigeminal nerve, root, and central tracts. Central nervous system lesions affecting sensory pathways, including strokes, multiple sclerosis, and cavernous hemangiomas can cause central itch. Neuropathic itch is a potent trigger of reflex and volitional scratching although this provides only fleeting relief. Rare patients whose lesion causes sensory loss as well as neuropathic itch can scratch deeply enough to cause painless self-injury. The most common location is on the face (trigeminal trophic syndrome). Treating neuropathic itch is difficult; antihistamines, corticosteroids, and most pain medications are largely ineffective. Current treatment recommendations include local or systemic administration of inhibitors of neuronal excitability (especially local anesthetics) and barriers to reduce scratching.",

I will get tested but people have told me that you need to wait at least 1-3 months for it to be reliable. From what I have read, the chances of getting hiv from unprotected vaginal sex are actually quite low (like 0.1% or less).

    "document": "The Role of Acute and Early HIV Infection in the Sexual Transmission of HIV\nPurpose of Review \n             Acute HIV infection (AHI), the earliest period after HIV acquisition, is only a few weeks in duration. In this brief period, the concentration of HIV in blood and genital secretions is extremely high, increasing the probability of HIV transmission. Although a substantial role of AHI in the sexual transmission of HIV is biologically plausible, the significance of AHI in the epidemiological spread of HIV remains uncertain. \n           \n           \n             Recent Findings \n             AHI is diagnosed by detecting viral RNA or antigen in the blood of persons who are HIV seronegative. Depending on the setting, persons with AHI represent between 1% and 10% of persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection. The high concentration of virus during AHI leads to increased infectiousness, possibly as much as 26 times greater than during chronic infection. In mathematical models, the estimated proportion of transmission attributed to AHI has varied considerably, depending on model structure, model parameters and the population. Key determinants include the stage of the HIV epidemic and the sexual risk profile of the population. \n           \n           \n             Summary \n             Despite its brief duration, AHI plays a disproportionate role in the sexual transmission of HIV infection.

However, melanonychia most often occurs as a result of benign etiologies such as nail matrix melanocytic activation, nail matrix melanocytic hyperplasia, and nail invasion by melanin-producing pathogens. Regrettably, patients with nail apparatus melanoma are often initially misdiagnosed, and due to diagnostic delays of an average of 2 years, melanoma of the nail unit carries a poor prognosis. Having a thorough knowledge of the various causes of melanonychia and using a systematic approach when evaluating brown-to-black nail pigmentation may help prevent misdiagnosis and thereby improve prognosis.",
    "response": "This is called linear melanonychia and is, in the majority of cases, benign. In some rare cases, it\u2019s malignant. Unfortunately, the only way to tell is biopsy. I would recommend evaluation by a dermatologist."

    "document": "Financial Responsibility of Hospitalized Patients Who Left Against Medical Advice: Medical Urban Legend?\nBACKGROUND \n             Physicians may counsel patients who leave against medical advice (AMA) that insurance will not pay for their care. However, it is unclear whether insurers deny payment for hospitalization in these cases. \n           \n           \n             OBJECTIVE \n             To review whether insurers denied payment for patients discharged AMA and assess physician beliefs and counseling practices when patients leave AMA. \n           \n           \n             DESIGN \n             Retrospective cohort of medical inpatients from 2001 to 2010; cross-sectional survey of physician beliefs and counseling practices for AMA patients in 2010. \n           \n           \n             PARTICIPANTS \n             Patients who left AMA from 2001 to 2010, internal medicine residents and attendings at a single academic institution, and a convenience sample of residents from 13 Illinois hospitals in June 2010. \n           \n           \n             MAIN MEASURES \n             Percent of AMA patients for which insurance denied payment, percent of physicians who agreed insurance denies payment for patients who leave AMA and who counsel patients leaving AMA they are financially responsible. \n           \n           \n             KEY RESULTS \n             Of 46,319 patients admitted from 2001 to 2010, 526 (1.1%) patients left AMA. Among insured patients, payment was refused in 4.1% of cases. Reasons for refusal were largely administrative (wrong name, etc.). No cases of payment refusal were because patient left AMA. Nevertheless, most residents (68.6%) and nearly half of attendings (43.9%) believed insurance denies payment when a patient leaves AMA. Attendings who believed that insurance denied payment were more likely to report informing AMA patients they may be held financially responsible (mean 4.2 vs. 1.7 on a Likert 1\u20135 scale, in which 5 is \u201calways\u201d inform,  p \u2009<\u20090.001).

    "document": "Examination of fluctuations in atmospheric pressure related to migraine\nBackground \n             Japan has four seasons and many chances of low atmospheric pressure or approaches of typhoon, therefore it has been empirically known that the fluctuation of weather induces migraine in people. Generally, its mechanism has been interpreted as follows: physical loading, attributed by atmospheric pressure to human bodies, compresses or dilates human blood vessels, which leads to abnormality in blood flow and induces migraine. We report our examination of the stage in which migraine tends to be induced focusing on the variation of atmospheric pressure. \n           \n           \n             Findings \n             Subjects were 34 patients with migraine, who were treated in our hospital. The patients included 31 females and three males, whose mean age was 32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7. 22 patients had migraine with aura and 12 patients had migraine without aura. All of patients with migraine maintained a headache diary to record atmospheric pressures when they developed a migraine. The standard atmospheric pressure was defined as 1013\u00a0hPa, and with this value as the criterion, we investigated slight fluctuations in the atmospheric pressure when they developed a migraine. It was found that the atmospheric pressure when the patients developed a migraine was within 1003\u20131007\u00a0hPa in the approach of low atmospheric pressure and that the patients developed a migraine when the atmospheric pressure decreased by 6\u201310\u00a0hPa, slightly less than the standard atmospheric pressure. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Small decreases of 6\u201310\u00a0hPa relative to the standard atmospheric pressure of 1013\u00a0hPa induced migraine attacks most frequently in patients with migraine.",

It\u2019s very common for primary care doctors to deal with depression and they will know what to do from there and what questions to ask you. Generally, if you mention you are feeling depressed they will ask about other symptoms of depression like changes in sleep and appetite. They will ask you about suicidal ideation. You can definitely talk to them about that. That won\u2019t get you sent to the hospital unless there\u2019s reason to believe you would actually hurt yourself. This usually means that you have a plan about how you would kill yourself and that you have the means to carry out that plan and that you intend to do so. Suicidal ideation is actually very common and it doesn\u2019t always mean that you need to be admitted to the hospital. After your appointment they will probably prescribe medications for you and schedule a follow up appointment for you."

As part of a larger trial, air particle monitors were placed in 298 homes of families with at least one cigarette smoker and one child under 14\u202fyears old in San Diego County, California. Assessment included past 7-day indoor cigarette and cannabis use, the youngest child's exposure to cigarette smoke, and 5 smoke-related past-year child health outcomes: emergency department use for coughing/difficulty breathing; physician diagnosis of ear infection, bronchitis/bronchiolitis, asthma, or eczema/atopic dermatitis. An ordinal measure of adverse health outcomes (0, 1, or \u22652) was regressed on reported indoor cannabis smoking\u2014the main measure of exposure (yes/no). Of 221 parents/guardians asked about cannabis use, 192 (86.9%) provided all required data, and 29 (15.1%) reported indoor cannabis smoking; reports were supported by air particle data. Homes without indoor smoking had lower average 7-day particle concentrations (1968 particles/0.01ft 3 ) than homes with cannabis smoking only (3131 particles/0.01ft 3 ), cigarette smoking only (3095 particles/0.01ft 3 ), or both cigarette and cannabis smoking (6006 particles/0.01ft 3 ).

The aim of this study was to detect the sensitivity and specificity of red reflex assessment in neonates, performed by pediatricians (or other care providers) in comparison with ophthalmologists. Also association between red reflex findings and neonatal variables is evaluated. \n           \n           \n             Methods: \n             By a prospective study all neonates born from July 2011 until March 2012 in Mustafa Hospital, a general teaching hospital in Ilam city, Iran, were evaluated. Neonates were firstly investigated by pediatrician in substandard conditions at the first day of birth and several days later by ophthalmologist in standard conditions. \n           \n           \n             Findings: \n             Totally 255 neonates including 141 boys and 114 girls were investigated, 144 of whom were born by cesarean section.

A significant difference (identification of ophthalmic problems) was seen among neonates\u2019 inspections in primary hours and substandard conditions compared to further inspections in standard conditions particularly from 3 rd  day of birth. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion: \n             Due to a considerable difference between the results of ophthalmic examination of neonates in different conditions, red reflex examination by pediatricians is suggested for all neonates to early identification of ophthalmic problems at the first step. It is also suggested a red reflex screening for all neonates before being discharged from hospital as well as 6 weeks later and in case of any problem to be referred to ophthalmologist.",

Fifty patients received standard preventive treatment, mainly supplements, and the experimental group received a single dose (according to body weight) of ivermectin, in addition to the same supplements the control group received. Results: There was no significant difference ( p  = 0.06) between Ct-values of the two groups before the regimen was started (day zero), indicating that subjects in both groups had similar viral loads. At 72 h after the regimen started, the increase in Ct-values was dramatically higher in the ivermectin than in the control group. In the ivermectin group, Ct increased from 15.13 \u00b1 2.07 (day zero) to 30.14 \u00b1 6.22 (day three; mean \u00b1 SD), compared to the control group, where the Ct values increased only from 14.20 \u00b1 2.48 (day zero) to 18.96 \u00b1 3.26 (day three; mean \u00b1 SD). Moreover, more subjects in the control group developed clinical symptoms. Three individuals (6%) required hospitalization, compared to the ivermectin group (0%). Conclusion: Ivermectin appears to be efficacious in providing clinical benefits in a randomized treatment of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects, effectively resulting in fewer symptoms, lower viral load and reduced hospital admissions. However, larger-scale trials are warranted for this conclusion to be further cemented.",

It doesn't do well with processing the much needed fats. \n\nSecond is called ecmo (extra corporal machine oxygenation), and that isn't compatible with any kind of active life. You can't move around when connected to a device that pumps 5 liters of blood per minute in resting conditions. Plus it would be very harmful because your immune system does not like to be outside your body in a machine. It will cause constant inflammation."

He has no record or history of seizures, and has had no appetite and has been nauseous the last two weeks, losing 11lbs.\nToday, he was throwing up all day, but seemed fine nonetheless. He was sitting down, and I saw him took off to the side, and his whole body started shaking. His muscles were stiff, he was drooling, and his lips were twitching. I tried to get him to respond but he wouldn\u2019t. I immieditly called 911. He was shaking for around one minute, but he suddenly stood up and reached out for me, hitting my face. I ran outside because he seemed irrational. As I was outside, I saw him walk to the windows. He was scraping at the curtains, banging on the widow and running his hands on it. It didn\u2019t look like he was necessarily trying to get my attention, his head and eyes were moving all around, and he seemed almost possessed. He then moved over to the glass front door and did the same thing. I saw him sit back down on the couch and a police officer arrived. He went to the door, and my dad answered. He seemed to be awake and was talking. The officer told him he had a seizure and he seemed extremely confused, like he had no memory of what happened and he was \u201cfine.\u201d The officer asked him some questions like what day it was, if he had any medicine, and he gave weird answers and seemed to be losing his balance. He was completely out of it. The ambulance took him to the hospital where he had another seizure, but they\u2019re figuring things out from there. My only question is, is it normal for people to do that during/after a seizure? I told the officers and EMT\u2019s what happened and they seemed confused. He looked almost possessed, and was going absolutely crazy. He\u2019s never done anything like that. He has a history of anxiety and paranoia but not going crazy like that.

    "document": "Adult onset seizures: Clinical, etiological, and radiological profile\nIntroduction: \n             Adult onset seizure disorder is a major public health concern in terms of burden of disease, nature of illness, and its impact on individual, family, and community. This study was done to assess the clinical profile and etiology of adult onset seizures and correlates of clinical and radiological pattern. \n           \n           \n             Materials and Methods: \n             This was a prospective cross-sectional hospital-based study conducted on 100 cases presenting with adult onset seizures. \n           \n           \n             Results: \n             Adult onset seizures were most prevalent in the young and middle-aged adults than elderly; generalized seizures were more common than focal seizures. However, the incidence of generalized seizures showed a falling trend as the age advanced whereas focal seizures increased in incidence with advancing age. Overall, the most common etiology of seizures was stroke, followed by idiopathic and central nervous system infections; yet, most common etiology of adult onset generalized and focal seizures was idiopathic and stroke, respectively. Regarding etiology, among younger adults, idiopathic seizures were predominant, whereas among middle aged and elderly, stroke was the most common etiology. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions: \n             It is mandatory to deal carefully with each case of adult onset seizure with a tailor-made approach. Identification and awareness about the etiological factors and seizure type help in better management of these patients. Primary care physicians play a pivotal role in identifying patients with adult onset seizures and should encourage these patients to undergo neuroimaging so as to arrive at an appropriate etiological diagnosis. In the face of recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, the future prospective management of adult onset seizures appears bright and convincing.",

    "document": "Epidemiology of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder and Its Prevalence and Incidence Worldwide\nNeuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an uncommon inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, manifesting clinically as optic neuritis, myelitis, and certain brain and brainstem syndromes. Cases clinically diagnosed as NMOSD may include aquaporin 4 (AQP4)-antibody-seropositive autoimmune astrocytopathic disease, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-antibody-seropositive inflammatory demyelinating disease, and double-seronegative disease. AQP4-antibody disease has a high female-to-male ratio (up to 9:1), and its mean age at onset of ~40 years is later than that seen in multiple sclerosis. For MOG-antibody disease, its gender ratio is closer to 1:1, and it is more common in children than in adults. Its clinical phenotypes differ but overlap with those of AQP4-antibody disease and include acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, brainstem and cerebral cortical encephalitis, as well as optic neuritis and myelitis. Double-seronegative disease requires further research and clarification. Population-based studies over the past two decades report the prevalence and incidence of NMOSD in different populations worldwide. One relevant finding is the varying prevalence observed in different racial groups. Consistently, the prevalence of NMOSD among Whites is ~1/100,000 population, with an annual incidence of <1/million population. Among East Asians, the prevalence is higher, at ~3.5/100,000 population, while the prevalence in Blacks may be up to 10/100,000 population. For MOG-antibody disease, hospital-based studies largely do not observe any significant racial preponderance so far. This disorder comprises a significant proportion of NMOSD cases that are AQP4-antibody-seronegative. A recent Dutch nationwide study reported the annual incidence of MOG-antibody disease as 1.6/million population (adult: 1.3/million, children: 3.1/million). Clinical and radiological differences between AQP4-antibody and MOG-antibody associated diseases have led to interest in the revisions of NMOSD definition and expanded stratification based on detection of a specific autoantibody biomarker. More population-based studies in different geographical regions and racial groups will be useful to further inform the prevalence and incidence of NMOSD and their antibody-specific subgroups. Accessibility to AQP4-antibody and MOG-antibody testing, which is limited in many centers, is a challenge to overcome. Environmental and genetic studies will be useful accompaniments to identify other potential pathogenetic factors and specific biomarkers in NMOSD.",

    "document": "Autoimmune Epilepsy\nThe field of autoimmune epilepsy has evolved substantially in the last few decades with discovery of several neural autoantibodies and improved mechanistic understanding of these immune-mediated syndromes. A considerable proportion of patients with epilepsy of unknown etiology have been demonstrated to have an autoimmune cause. The majority of the patients with autoimmune epilepsy usually present with new-onset refractory seizures along with subacute progressive cognitive decline and behavioral or psychiatric dysfunction. Neural specific antibodies commonly associated with autoimmune epilepsy include leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1), N-methyl- d -aspartate receptor (NMDA-R), and glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65) IgG. Diagnosis of these cases depends on the identification of the clinical syndrome and ancillary studies including autoantibody evaluation. Predictive models (Antibody Prevalence in Epilepsy and Encephalopathy [APE2] and Response to Immunotherapy in Epilepsy and Encephalopathy [RITE2] scores) based on clinical features and initial neurological assessment may be utilized for selection of cases for autoimmune epilepsy evaluation and management. In this article, we will review the recent advances in autoimmune epilepsy and provide diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for epilepsies with suspected autoimmune etiology.",

    "document": "Autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein astrocytopathy\nPurpose of review \n             To describe a recently characterized autoimmune, inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) disorder known as autoimmune glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy. \n           \n           \n             Recent findings \n             Affected patients present with symptoms of one or more of meningitis (headache and neck ache), encephalitis (delirium, tremor, seizures, or psychiatric symptoms), and myelitis (sensory symptoms and weakness). Optic disc papillitis (blurred vision) is common. CNS inflammation is evident in characteristic T1 postgadolinium enhancement of GFAP-enriched CNS regions, and lymphocytic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white cell count elevation. CSF is more reliable than serum for GFAP-immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing. Ovarian teratoma commonly coexists, particularly among patients with accompanying N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor or aquaporin-4 autoimmunity. Parainfectious autoimmunity is suspected in some other patients, though the culprit organism is rarely verified. Pathophysiologic relevance of T cells is underscored by neuropathology and cases of dysregulated T-cell function (HIV or checkpoint inhibitor cancer therapy). Corticosteroid-responsiveness is a hallmark of the disease. Relapses occur in approximately 20% of patients, necessitating transition to a steroid-sparing drug. Reported outcomes vary, though in the authors\u2019 experience, early and sustained intervention usually portends recovery. \n           \n           \n             Summary \n             Autoimmune GFAP astrocytopathy is a treatable autoimmune CNS disease diagnosable by GFAP-IgG testing in CSF.

    "document": "The Current Status of Telemedicine Technology Use Across the World Health Organization European Region: An Overview of Systematic Reviews\nBackground \n             Several systematic reviews evaluating the use of telemedicine by clinicians, patients, and health authorities to improve the delivery of care in the 53 member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region have been conducted in recent years. However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

On 4/7, I got really exhausted during my walk, and could only do 1 mile.  The following day (4/8), I was shopping, and I could barely make it through the store, I was so out of breath. After getting back to my car, and catching my breath for about 30 seconds, I was fine, and made it back home. \n\nOn 4/9 the shortness of breath continued. I was out of breath in any position except laying down. I couldn't even sit up for work. I went to the ER in the evening. I had borderline troponin levels, but a normal ECG, and troponin didn't change on the next blood draw. I was released and recommended I follow up with my PCP.\n\nThe next week, 4/13, I met with Cardiologist A. I had another normal  ECG, and a Transthoracic Echo. While the study quality of the TTE wasn't great (due to my weight), nothing seemed out of the ordinary. I was referred to a Pulmonologist.\n\n(4/16) While at the pulmonologist, it was noticed that my blood oxygen dropped when I moved from sitting to standing. A heart shunt was suspected, and I was referred to Cardiologist B for a Transesophageal Echo. I was also given a Pulmonary Function test (normal) and a sleep study (I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea, with an AHI of 13).\n\n4/18: I developed Paroxysmal AFib. (AFib was seen via Apple Watch) The first event lasted about an hour and half. I didn't want to drive myself to ER, or call an ambulance so I waited it out. I talked to the on call doctor for the medical group I have been going to, and they said if it lasted more than 20 min. I should go to the ER. I had more bouts of it lasting 10-15 minutes. The next day, I was woken up with it, and headed to the ER (I had someone to drive me).\n\n4/19: At the ER, the AFib was confirmed by ECG, and I was given diltiazem. I have been taking that (+ baby aspirin) every day since and have not gotten another AFib event. (Though I do get frequent palpitations. A couple an hour on average)\n\n5/4: I saw cardiologist B. I was given a stress test, which came back abnormal (ST elevation or depression. I can't quite remember). He agreed that we should do a TEE to check for a shunt, but also wanted to do a CTA to check for coronary artery disease.  Due to insurance snafus, it would be a while before these could be done.\n\n5/22: I have a noticeable improvement in my condition. starting this day, and continuing on, while I wasn't back to 100%, I could go on errands, walk a few blocks, etc without getting absolutely fatigued or short of breath. \n\n5/28: TEE. Originally, it looks completely normal. No evidence of a shunt.\n\n6/3 CTA: Zero calcium score, no evidence of CAD. But an 8mm lesion, suspected Papillary Fibroelastoma is seen in my Aortic valve. Upon going back to review the TEE, it is also seen there.\n\n6/10: My steady improvement since 5/22 has a setback. I had a pretty rough day, had to be laying down/resting for most of it.\n\n... So, neither cardiologist thinks that the Fibroelastoma is the cause of my symptoms. I asked cardiologist A about the TTE, and he said that the tumor wasn't seen during the study. I asked to clarify if he could not see well enough, or if he could confirm that it wasn't there at the time. I got a non-answer \"it wasn't seen\". We are going to do another TTE in 6 months to check it out.\n\nUntil yesterday, when I had a setback in my improvement, I was satisfied with this. But if I am not improving, I want to keep exploring what could be causing my fatigue/dyspnea. (Not to mention the AFib)\n\nThough neither cardiologist thinks so, I think it could be related to the tumor. See [this]( study.\n\nAlso, since it was discovered incidentally, we (or at least I), don't know if it is mobile or not. \"Tumor mobility is an independent predictor of death or nonfatal embolization, and in these patients, surgical intervention should be considered.\" [source](\n\nI haven't experienced any chest pain, fainting, or long lasting dizziness (long-lasting being > 1 second). I do sometimes feel pressure in my chest... like I have gas, or I have to burp, though no burp comes. \n\nSo I guess my main question is: Could the tumor be causing my symptoms? And should I get a follow up TTE sooner than 6 months? I have a hard time finding information about how quickly these things can grow. But if it is the cause of my symptoms, and those have only been going on for 2 months. 6 seems like an awfully long time to wait.",
    "document": "Papillary Fibroelastoma of the Aortic Valve\nPapillary fibroelastomas are the most common benign neoplasms of the cardiac valvular structures, and they are being recognized more frequently because of higher-resolution imaging technology. Papillary fibroelastomas are associated with substantial complications that are secondary to systemic embolism. Incidentally discovered papillary fibroelastomas are treated on the basis of their size, mobility, and associated comorbidities and symptoms. Surgical resection should be offered to all patients who have symptoms and to asymptomatic patients who have pedunculated lesions or tumors larger than 1 cm in diameter. Valve-sparing excision produces good long-term results in most instances. \n           Herein, we present the case of a patient who was scheduled for elective myocardial revascularization and in whom an aortic valve papillary fibroelastoma was discovered incidentally during routine intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. The timely recognition of this asymptomatic tumor enabled a modified operative approach: the patient underwent myocardial revascularization with concomitant valve-sparing resection of the tumor. We discuss the pathophysiology of fibroelastomas of the aortic valve and operative approaches to the management of these tumors when they are discovered incidentally.",

I would also be pushing for a diagnosis, because borderline troponin, PAF, and CPF in your age is unusual. If they have no alternative I would want them to treat the tumour as the presumed cause, if that makes sense."

    "document": "Autism Behavior Inventory: A Novel Tool for Assessing Core and Associated Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorder\nAbstract \n           Objective:  Autism Behavior Inventory (ABI) is a new measure for assessing changes in core and associated symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in participants (ages: 3 years-adulthood) diagnosed with ASD. It is a web-based tool with five domains (two ASD core domains: social communication, restrictive and repetitive behaviors; three associated domains: mental health, self-regulation, and challenging behavior). This study describes design, development, and initial psychometric properties of the ABI. \n           Methods:  ABI items were generated following review of existing measures and inputs from expert clinicians. Initial ABI scale contained 161 items that were reduced to fit a factor analytic model, retaining items of adequate reliability. Two versions of the scale, ABI-full (ABI-F; 93 items) and ABI-short version (ABI-S; 36 items), were developed and evaluated for psychometric properties, including validity comparisons with commonly used measures. Both scales were administered to parents and healthcare professionals (HCPs) involved with study participants. \n           Results:  Test\u2013retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]\u2009=\u20090.79) for parent ratings on ABI was robust and compared favorably to existing scales. Test\u2013retest correlations for HCP ratings were generally lower versus parent ratings. ABI core domains and comparison measures strongly correlated ( r \u2009\u2265\u20090.70), demonstrating good concurrent validity. \n           Conclusions:  Overall, ABI demonstrates promise as a tool for measuring change in core symptoms of autism in ASD clinical studies, with further validation required.",

    "document": "Prediction of COVID-19 Infections for Municipalities in the Netherlands: Algorithm Development and Interpretation\nBackground \n             COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China. The virus quickly spread and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. After infection, symptoms such as fever, a (dry) cough, nasal congestion, and fatigue can develop. In some cases, the virus causes severe complications such as pneumonia and dyspnea and could result in death. The virus also spread rapidly in the Netherlands, a small and densely populated country with an aging population. Health care in the Netherlands is of a high standard, but there were nevertheless problems with hospital capacity, such as the number of available beds and staff. There were also regions and municipalities that were hit harder than others. In the Netherlands, there are important data sources available for daily COVID-19 numbers and information about municipalities. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             We aimed to predict the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands, using a data set with the properties of 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and advanced modeling techniques. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We collected relevant static data per municipality from data sources that were available in the Dutch public domain and merged these data with the dynamic daily number of infections from January 1, 2020, to May 9, 2021, resulting in a data set with 355 municipalities in the Netherlands and variables grouped into 20 topics. The modeling techniques random forest and multiple fractional polynomials were used to construct a prediction model for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants per municipality in the Netherlands. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The final prediction model had an  R 2  of 0.63. Important properties for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality in the Netherlands were exposure to particulate matter with diameters <10 \u03bcm (PM10) in the air, the percentage of Labour party voters, and the number of children in a household. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Data about municipality properties in relation to the cumulative number of confirmed infections in a municipality in the Netherlands can give insight into the most important properties of a municipality for predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 infections per 10,000 inhabitants in a municipality. This insight can provide policy makers with tools to cope with COVID-19 and may also be of value in the event of a future pandemic, so that municipalities are better prepared.",

In appears that tolerance develops relatively quickly for the sedative and anticonvulsant actions of benzodiazepines, whereas tolerance to anxiolytic and amnesic effects probably does not develop at all. In light of this evidence, we review the current evidence for the neuroadaptive mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine tolerance, including changes of (i) the GABA A  receptor (subunit expression and receptor coupling), (ii) intracellular changes stemming from transcriptional and neurotrophic factors, (iii) ionotropic glutamate receptors, (iv) other neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine systems), and (v) the neurosteroid system. From the large variance in the studies, it appears that either different (simultaneous) tolerance mechanisms occur depending on the benzodiazepine effect, or that the tolerance-inducing mechanism depends on the activated GABA A  receptor subtypes.

    "document": "Influence of Tryptophan and Serotonin on Mood and Cognition with a Possible Role of the Gut-Brain Axis\nThe serotonergic system forms a diffuse network within the central nervous system and plays a significant role in the regulation of mood and cognition. Manipulation of tryptophan levels, acutely or chronically, by depletion or supplementation, is an experimental procedure for modifying peripheral and central serotonin levels. These studies have allowed us to establish the role of serotonin in higher order brain function in both preclinical and clinical situations and have precipitated the finding that low brain serotonin levels are associated with poor memory and depressed mood. The gut-brain axis is a bi-directional system between the brain and gastrointestinal tract, linking emotional and cognitive centres of the brain with peripheral functioning of the digestive tract. An influence of gut microbiota on behaviour is becoming increasingly evident, as is the extension to tryptophan and serotonin, producing a possibility that alterations in the gut may be important in the pathophysiology of human central nervous system disorders. In this review we will discuss the effect of manipulating tryptophan on mood and cognition, and discuss a possible influence of the gut-brain axis.",

    "document": "Population-wide persistent hemostatic changes after vaccination with ChAdOx1-S\nVarious vaccines were developed to reduce the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Cov-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Quickly after the start of vaccination, reports emerged that anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including ChAdOx1-S, could be associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. We investigated the hemostatic changes after ChAdOx1-S vaccination in 631 health care workers. Blood samples were collected 32 days on average after the second ChAdOx1-S vaccination, to evaluate hemostatic markers such as D-dimer, fibrinogen, \u03b12-macroglobulin, FVIII and thrombin generation. Endothelial function was assessed by measuring Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and active VWF. IL-6 and IL-10 were measured to study the activation of the immune system. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 anti-nucleoside and anti-spike protein antibody titers were determined. Prothrombin and fibrinogen levels were significantly reduced after vaccination (\u22127.5% and \u221216.9%,  p  < 0.0001). Significantly more vaccinated subjects were outside the normal range compared to controls for prothrombin (42.1% vs. 26.4%,  p  = 0.026) and antithrombin (23.9% vs. 3.6%,  p  = 0.0010). Thrombin generation indicated a more procoagulant profile, characterized by a significantly shortened lag time (\u221211.3%,  p  < 0.0001) and time-to-peak (\u221213.0% and  p  < 0.0001) and an increased peak height (32.6%,  p  = 0.0015) in vaccinated subjects compared to unvaccinated controls. Increased VWF (+39.5%,  p  < 0.0001) and active VWF levels (+24.1 %,  p  < 0.0001) pointed toward endothelial activation, and IL-10 levels were significantly increased (9.29 pg/mL vs. 2.43 pg/mL,  p  = 0.032). The persistent increase of IL-10 indicates that the immune system remains active after ChAdOx1-S vaccination. This could trigger a pathophysiological mechanism causing an increased thrombin generation profile and vascular endothelial activation, which could subsequently result in and increased risk of thrombotic events.",

One, while it isn't static in severity, seems to stay within a certain range, pain-wise. Mostly in my shoulders, knees, back, and groin area. It's a dull, flu-like ache, and never goes away. It's at its worst when I wake up. The other type is this random, sudden, terribly intense stabbing pain that can occur anywhere on my body, from between my toes, to my joints and muscles, to my ear, or my genitals, and basically everywhere in between. It usually happens repeatedly, not in a regular rhythm, between 30 seconds and 10 minutes duration. It may be a bit more likely at night, but not very distinguishably so. \n\nI saw an orthopedic specialist, and he confirmed the arthritis, and told me there was nothing else wrong with me.\n\nIn August of 2019, sudden onset of extreme pressure in my right ear. The pressure initially lasted about a week, during which I started having tinnitus in that ear. The pressure sometimes comes back, but the ringing in my ear hasn't ceased since it began. I'm pretty sure I'm losing hearing in that ear. Sometimes I have heavy TMJ pain with the pressure, when it happens.\n\nI saw an ENT, had an exam and a hearing test, and nothing else, other than him reviewing the CT. He said it would all probably go away on its own. When I called and told him it had not, he told me to quit smoking and go to a tinnitus clinic. \n\nStill not getting any help, miserable and frustrated, I went to a rheumatologist at my GP's referral. He literally didn't do a single test, and basically said it was all in my head. \n\nI saw a total of 6 doctors, over maybe fifteen visits. \n\nEvery doctor told me to lose weight and quit smoking, as if that would solve everything. They offered no other solutions or more in depth diagnostic procedures.\n\nI was in the process of losing weight when all this started. I've struggled with that since I was a small child. The orthopedist told me that losing 5% of my body weight would significantly reduce my pain. I had already lost over fifty pounds, WELL over 5%, and managed to maintain that loss for several months. It didn't help. Not even a little. He ignored any possible diagnostic implications of that, saying only that \"We should always celebrate these little victories.\" My pain continued to worsen, and physical activity/exercise became more and more difficult and painful. I've since gained back about half of what I lost. \n\nEvery doctor told me to quit smoking. I tried so hard, and managed for maybe six months before I caved to the immense stress and started back. Not once during that six months did my sinus or chest congestion, cough, or trouble breathing improve, without the aid of steroids. \n\nI felt completely dismissed and minimized, humiliated by the doctors' constant harping on the possibly obvious causes that don't seem to affect my symptoms, while refusing to even consider any other possibilities. It felt both useless and traumatizing to even think about trying to find another doctor.\n\nEarly this year, I started occasionally experiencing fluid leaking from my ear. It's usually clear, but sometimes has a very faint yellowish or pinkish tint. \n\nAbout four months ago, I started having diarrhea, almost every time I eat anything, usually within less than an hour of starting to eat. My gut has been kind of sensitive and temperamental for years, but this is way beyond anything I've ever experienced for this long. I'm not dehydrated. I have very little appetite. I'm down to about one meal a day, and maybe one snack 2-3 days a week. I stopped drinking coffee, I've never been a drinker, as far as alcohol is concerned, and I have tried the BRAT diet several times. Unless I take at least 2 Imodium every day, this problem continues. \n\nI started having some sort of heartburn/acid reflux thing, which I started taking Prilosec for, but I still have breakthrough episodes that seem completely unrelated to what or whether I eat. Even with the Prilosec, I take several Tums, probably 3-4 days a week. \n\nMy vision suddenly worsened early this year, and I got glasses for the first time in my life, and my eyes are almost always dry, but somehow also watery. They seem to be producing more eye gunk than they ever have, too, and not just when I'm asleep. \n\nAs far as medications are concerned, I am only taking three prescribed medications, Zoloft and valium. 100 & 5 mg, respectively, once a day, and an Albuterol rescue inhaler. The rest is vitamins and over the counter stuff for everything. I drink generic Theraflu for the congestion/cough as needed, and take a Zyrtec once a day. It's the only thing I've found that helps. I take the highest concentration of Charlotte's Web CBD oil for the seizures, once a day. Prilosec, once a day. Imodium, two tablets per day, but I usually skip a couple of days every couple of weeks. Tums as needed. OTC pain meds as needed. \n\nI feel like I'm dying slowly, and no one can or will help me. I'd kind of rather just get it over with, than suffering like this much longer. \n\nPlease, if ANY doctor has any ideas on what might be wrong with me, or how to get doctors to actually listen to me, or what *kind* of doctor I should see, please help me. I'm at the end of my rope. \n\nThank you.\n\n### Edited to add: \n\nHuge thanks to the peanut gallery, but I DON'T actually have COPD. Sorry I didn't include in the OP, but the pulmonologist said there was no obstruction, and that this was unequivocally NOT that. If he'd said it was, I probably wouldn't be asking in here for answers. But go off. \ud83d\ude44\n\nI didn't deny that my weight is problematic. I'm fully aware. But it is NOT the source of the symptoms I'm currently having. I've always struggled with my weight, since I was maybe 6 or 7 years old, but it's never been this bad, before I started having seizures, when I weighed around 170 lbs. The medication roller coaster I was on for several years before they deemed my seizures intractable left me with about 60 extra pounds. The condition the seizures left my body in, afterwards, made it impossible to lose weight for a long time. When I was able to lose weight, I did. Fifty pounds. Then I got extremely ill, and now I can barely get out of bed, let alone cook or exercise. But I guess if it makes you feel better to harp on me about the ***results*** of my health issues, rather than helping me figure out what is *causing* them, that says something about you. I'm basically shitting my brains out, and only eating one moderately sized meal a day, but yeah. The weight that I'm not losing while having no appetite and being sick as soon as I eat anything is **totally** what we need to focus on, first. \n\nI did quit smoking for a while. The fact that my life had become basically endless misery and I felt like I was dying, added to the fact that quitting produced a host of other issues (including weight gain - imagine that!) and I basically had no pleasure in anything and wanted to die, kind of made it seem like maybe smoking wouldn't be so bad. At that point, I figured if I was dying and nobody would help me, may as well hurry it along. It helps me deal with... everything. Sue me. \n\nBut yeah, sure. To hell with me unless I admit I'm a horrible lazy slob who needs to basically change the demonstrably unsurmountable ***effect*** of my illnesses, or give up one of the few pleasures I have left, right? If I debase myself and admit I'm a stupid idiot, could we maybe move on to talking about, oh, I don't know, ***my. Actual. SYMPTOMS???***\n\nSeriously. If you're going to be a jerk, and you're not a doctor, why? You don't know as much as you think you do, and you're not helping anyone. If you **are** a doctor, please understand that I'm already doing the absolute best I am capable of, and I'm desperate. But ignoring 90% of my symptoms to focus in on the smoking and obesity is not going to help me. That's the problem that led me here in the first place. I'm not sick because I'm fat. I'm fat because I'm sick. And smoking, while it may be contributing to a couple of the things that are happening to me, is completely unrelated to most. I'd be really grateful if, instead of ignoring everything else, those who can't look past the one portion of symptoms that may be related to smoking just pretended that *those* symptoms don't exist, and focus on the ones they can make themselves care about.",
    "document": "Weight Discrimination and Risk of Mortality\nDiscrimination based on weight is a stressful social experience linked to declines in physical and mental health. We examine whether this harmful association extends to risk of mortality. Participants in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS;  N =13,692) and the Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS;  N =5,079) reported on discriminatory experiences and attributed those experiences to personal characteristics, including weight. Weight discrimination was associated with a nearly 60% increased mortality risk in both HRS (HR=1.57, 95% CI=1.34-1.84) and MIDUS (HR=1.59, 95% CI=1.09-2.31) that was not accounted for by common physical and psychological risk factors.

    "response": "Hi,\n\nI would presume you have had a vast array of testing which you haven\u2019t listed here. There are only so many tests we can do to look for problems. If they\u2019re all coming back normal, it becomes very difficult to label a disease progress. However, what is normal now may change in time and declare itself.\n\nI would suggest you go back to your primary physician, a long consult and look at what you\u2019ve done so far. Identify your primary issue/s and then plan to address them one at a time. Doctors these days have very tight time frames to work within, and expecting one doctor to address all of these issues in one sitting is not possible. Chalk that up to expectations of administrators and the public.\n\nPotentially review with a rheumatologist again, some of the symptoms (myalgia, dry eyes, reflux) could suggest some rheumatological type condition. You could also consider a neurologist, both for the epilepsy and migraines. Is there any reason you are taking CBD oil alone and no anti epileptics?\n\nAlso this all sounds understandably very difficult for you. I would suggest a counsellor/psychologist/psychiatrist.\n\nFinally, from a doctors point of view. You are describing a vast array of health issues, including breathing issues on a background of asthma. Your weight and smoking will be contributory to both of these issues, and likely many others. Yes, you have lost weight and you tried to quit smoking. Yes it is difficult. But unfortunately you are still in the morbidly obese. There are endless studies about the effects of obesity and smoking on the body. We know how bad it is and we know how bad it is going to get (from a population perspective). Doctors will/should always recommend and encourage weight loss for health.\n\nWhen a patient, who is negatively affected by these *modifiable lifestyle factors* is in denial about their contribution or does not believe they are involved and consequently dismisses the doctors advice. It becomes harder for the doctor to engage. We are human too. We will try our best, but if we can not develop the rapport with a patient about something so obvious, we will struggle to convince them of anything. I am not saying this is you, but we see it a lot.\n\nI think a prime example is the anti vaxxers and covid/covid vaccination. It can be like bashing our head against an often aggressive and derogatory brick wall. It is exhausting and demoralising. The same can be said for other patients, for example morbidly obese patients with chronic back pain. Numerous studies have shown that weight loss and physiotherapist are the most reliable methods of pain reduction over all else. But convincing a great many of those patients of this fact is impossible.\n\nI wish you all the best. Again, long consult with your PCP. Develop a list of key issues to address and work through them."

Smoker\n\nDiagnosed physical conditions: \n* **Intractable epilepsy** (tonic clonic seizures, averaging between 1&2/month, onset age 28) - I *believe* I had absence seizures from childhood, but my parents never took us to the Dr., and there's no way for me to be sure, now. No significant response to pharmaceutical treatments. CBD oil has decreased my frequency, though. It varied in the first few years, and was once as frequent as 3-4 seizures per week. I do have auras, and they now happen mainly in or around sleep.\n* **Migraines** - diagnosed as a teenager, fairly rare and random, but debilitating.\n* Seasonal allergies\n* **Asthma** - diagnosed age 33, usually mild unless I have a respiratory illness, or overexert myself physically. \n* **Osteoarthritis** in my knees - diagnosed during first pregnancy at age 21\n\nIn May of 2019, I started having symptoms of a sinus infection, and they just never went away. The nasal congestion mostly stopped, but the severe chest congestion, trouble breathing, and frequent, heavy, productive cough is still going. I was referred to a pulmonologist, and did lung function testing and a sleep study. I had normal spirometry and moderately reduced diffusing capacity. My FVC was 2.38 liters, and FEV1 was 1.85. The FEV1/FVC ratio was 77.6%. My API was 6. While I have no idea what any of that means, he said I had very mild sleep apnea, and was otherwise unconcerned. He ordered a chest and sinus CT, and both were normal. I still have the severe cough, trouble breathing and chest/sinus congestion, continuously, and occasional nasal congestion/irritation. I've had it for 29 months, and have only seen temporary improvement when on short courses of steroids. My GP ran a bunch of labs in June, including a CBC with differential.

We defined people with healthy obesity (HO) as meeting all 3 indices of blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood lipids. People with unhealthy obesity crossed the risk threshold for all 3 criteria. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             In both healthy and unhealthy subgroups, risks for CHD, stroke, and mortality were comparable among BMI status during a mean 18.7-year follow-up. When compared with HO, hazard ratios were increased for diabetes (5.56, 95% CI 4.12\u20137.48), CHD (5.60, CI 3.14\u20139.98), stroke (4.84, CI 2.13\u201310.97), and mortality (2.6, CI 1.88\u20133.61) in people with unhealthy obesity. BMI only moderately increased the risks for diabetes among healthy subjects. In CARDIA over 20 years, 17.5 % of lean subjects and 67.3% of overweight subjects at baseline became obese during follow-up. Despite rising BMI, metabolic status remained relatively stable. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Metabolic status is relatively stable despite rising BMI.

    "document": "Capsaicin for Rhinitis\nRhinitis is a multifactorial disease characterized by symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and nasal congestion. Non-allergic rhinitis is characterized by rhinitis symptoms without systemic sensitization of infectious etiology. Based on endotypes, we can categorize non-allergic rhinitis into an inflammatory endotype with usually eosinophilic inflammation encompassing at least NARES and LAR and part of the drug induced rhinitis (e.g., aspirin intolerance) and a neurogenic endotype encompassing idiopathic rhinitis, gustatory rhinitis, and rhinitis of the elderly. Patients with idiopathic rhinitis have a higher baseline TRPV1 expression in the nasal mucosa than healthy controls. Capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) is the active component of chili peppers, plants of the genus Capsicum. Capsaicin is unique among naturally occurring irritant compounds because the initial neuronal excitation evoked by it is followed by a long-lasting refractory period, during which the previously excited neurons are no longer responsive to a broad range of stimuli. Patients with idiopathic rhinitis benefit from intranasal treatment with capsaicin. Expression of TRPV1 is reduced in patients with idiopathic rhinitis after capsaicin treatment. Recently, in a Cochrane review, the effectiveness of capsaicin in the management of idiopathic rhinitis was evaluated and the authors concluded that given that many other options do not work well in non-allergic rhinitis, capsaicin is a reasonable option to try under physician supervision. Capsaicin has not been shown to be effective in allergic rhinitis nor in other forms of non-allergic rhinitis like the inflammatory endotypes or other neurogenic endotypes like rhinitis of the elderly or smoking induced rhinitis.",

Instances of persistent neurologic dysfunction as well as neuropsychiatric abnormalities are now being recognised and warrant active follow up of these patients. Although evidences irreversible neurologic damage is uncommon after ALF, neuropsychiatric disturbances are not uncommon. Complex pathogenesis is involved in neurocognitive disorders seen after many other conditions including LT that require critical care. Structural damage and persistent neurological abnormalities seen after ALF are more likely to be related to cerebral edema, raised intracranial tension and cerebral hypoxemia, while neurocognitive dysfunctions may be a part of a wider spectrum of disorders commonly seen among those who recover from any critical illness",

This systematic literature review and meta\u2010analysis aimed to assess the impact of \u22653 months of exposure to anticholinergics as a class on the risk of dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and change in cognitive function. The impact of anticholinergic agents specifically used to treat overactive bladder was also evaluated. \n           \n           \n             Materials and Methods \n             A systematic literature review was conducted to identify English language articles evaluating the impact of anticholinergic use for \u22653 months on dementia or cognitive function in adult patients. Databases searched included PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Meta\u2010analyses were conducted using random\u2010effects models; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and 95% prediction intervals (PIs) were reported. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             A total of 2122 records were identified. Out of those, 21 studies underwent qualitative synthesis and 6 reported endpoints relevant for inclusion in a meta\u2010analysis assessing the risk of incident dementia. The overall rate ratio for incident dementia was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.17\u20131.81; 95% PI: 0.70\u20133.04;  n \u2009=\u20096). The risk of incident dementia increased with increasing exposure ( n \u2009=\u20093). In addition, two studies from the meta\u2010analysis reported an increased risk of dementia with \u22653 months of\u00a0use of bladder antimuscarinics (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.21 to 1.65, depending on exposure category). \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Anticholinergic use for \u22653 months increased the risk of dementia on average by an estimated 46% versus nonuse.

Improvement (reduction) in ICT lures and 1st minus 2nd halves (\u0394L 1\u20132 ) were used to determine learning of response inhibition. Two cross-sectional studies (A and B) compared data from stable cirrhotics, with or without prior OHE. We then prospectively assessed cognitive performance, before and after the first episode of OHE. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             In study A, (226 cirrhotic patients) 54 had experienced OHE, 120 had minimal HE and 52 with no minimal HE.

Learning of response inhibition (\u0394L 1\u20132  \u22651), was evident in patients with minimal HE and no minimal HE, but was lost after OHE. In study B (50 additional patients who developed \u22651 documented OHE episode during follow-up), the number of OHE hospitalizations correlated with severity of residual impairment, indicated by ICT lures (r=0.5, P=0.0001), DST (r=\u22120.39, P=0.002) and NCT-B (r=0.33, P=0.04).

    "document": "Left ventricular wall motion in patients with Chagas's disease.\nThe effect of early chronic Chagas's disease on the timing and extent of regional left ventricular wall motion was studied with a frame by frame analysis of left ventriculograms in nine patients and compared with those in 19 normal subjects. In all the patients there was hypokinesis or akinesis in the anteroapical region together with delay in the onset of inward movement. Hypokinesis of the proximal inferior segment was also present, but the time of onset of inward motion here was normal. These differences can be explained on the basis of regional asynchrony within the normal left ventricle, where anteroapical wall motion is delayed with respect to that elsewhere. Thus contraction of the diseased anteroapical segment starts against an appreciable pressure and so may be isometric, whereas the affected proximal inferior segment starts contracting earlier against a lower pressure and so is able to shorten. No abnormalities of wall motion were seen during isovolumic relaxation despite segmental involvement, which is a distinctly different finding from that in patients with coronary artery disease. This may be due partly to the absence of incoordinate relaxation in Chagas's disease and partly to myocardial involvement by Chagas's disease in the mid-anterior segment. This is the site of rapid early diastolic wall thinning, which has been put forward as a major mechanism of normal rapid ventricular filling and whose premature activity causes disturbances in regional wall motion before mitral valve opening when relaxation is incoordinate. Thus quantitative analysis of both the timing and amplitude of wall motion indicates fundamental differences between Chagas's disease and coronary artery disease, when a less complex analysis would have shown a similar pattern of segmental dysfunction in both. Since the effect of the same pathological process on wall motion varies with the site of ventricular involvement, the importance of the disturbances seen in Chagas's disease becomes apparent only when the non-uniformity of normal left ventricular structure and function is taken into account. \n           \n             Images",

I failed to take the whole dose at once as instructed. I realized I had missed pouring about a quarter of it into my water, and then I did end up taking the rest about 12 hours later. That was on May 4th or so. \n\nThe only symptom I had ever noticed was just daily cervical mucus / vaginal discharge that didn\u2019t seem abnormal but was more copious than usual. That mostly dried up about a week after I took the medicine. \n\nBut for the past week I\u2019ve still noticed some kind of gummy discharge first thing in the morning. And a couple days ago, it looked like some brown spotting. Yesterday it looked sort of pinkish/yellowish. I thought maybe my period was about to start. \n\nBut today it looked mostly a yellowish color when I wiped. I only noticed it first thing in the morning and not since then. \n\nI\u2019m worried the azithromycin didn\u2019t treat the chlamydia, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just reading too much into the mucus/discharge. It doesn\u2019t seem abnormal except that I wouldn\u2019t really expect to see any mucus right now in my cycle, and it is a different color than usual.\n\nShould I get retested for chlamydia? How soon would it show up again if the antibiotic is now longer in my system? I don\u2019t want it to lead to any complications but I also don\u2019t want to retest too soon and get a false negative.

While most repeat positive cases are likely to be reinfections, emerging evidence indicates treatment failure may play a role. Current data suggests that there may are differences in the efficacy of the drugs between rectal and non-rectal sites of infection and factors such as immune response, drug pharmacokinetics, organism load, auto-inoculation from rectum to cervix in women and the genital microbiome may play a role in treatment failure. Other possible reasons for repeat infection include the low discriminatory power of NAAT tests to differentiate between viable and nonviable organisms and failure to detect LGV infection. This review will present the current evidence regarding the management challenges for urogenital and anorectal chlamydia infections and provide some suggestions for where future research efforts are needed to address important knowledge gaps in this area and provide stronger evidence for the development of robust treatment guidelines.",
    "response": "I typically recommend retesting at 6-12 weeks anyway (for people that take the usual dose it is to test for re-infection). \n\nCall your provider. If my patient told me this story, I would just retreat because the azithromycin is so low risk and has minimal side effects. Maybe not what every doctor would do, but that\u2019s my practice whenever a patient is concerned about getting the whole dose. You can also get treated in pill form if that is easier. \n\nAlso, make sure your partner was treated if you are still involved. Make sure all partners are treated. In non-monogamous couples I also treat female partners. The most common reason that a woman has persistent chlamydia infection is because she was re-infected by a partner that wasn\u2019t treated. Many states in the US allow the gynecologist to send medication for \u201cexpedited partner treatment\u201d as well. \n\nChlamydia is very very common, and rarely causes complications. It is usually asymptomatic.\n\nEdit: Also, use condoms until you speak with your gynecologist. I typically recommend condoms for two weeks after treatment, unless an atypical situation like being unsure about treatment."

    "document": "Home garden use during COVID-19: Associations with physical and mental wellbeing in older adults\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of people's lives. Lockdown measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have been more stringent for those aged over 70, at highest risk for the disease. Here, we examine whether home garden usage is associated with self-reported mental and physical wellbeing in older adults, during COVID-19 lockdown in Scotland. This study analysed data from 171 individuals (mean age 84\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 years) from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study who completed an online survey approximately two months after lockdown commenced (May/June, 2020), and reported having access to a home garden. The survey also included items on garden activities (gardening, relaxing), frequency of garden usage during lockdown, and measures of self-rated physical health, emotional and mental health, anxiety about COVID-19, and sleep quality. Ordinal regression models were adjusted for sex, living alone, education, occupational social class, anxiety and depressive symptoms, body mass index, and history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Neither gardening nor relaxing in the garden were associated with health outcomes. However, higher frequency of garden usage during lockdown was associated with better self-rated physical health ( P \u00a0=\u00a00.005), emotional and mental health ( P \u00a0=\u00a00.04), sleep quality ( P \u00a0=\u00a00.03), and a composite health score ( P \u00a0=\u00a00.001), after adjusting for covariates. None of the garden measures were associated with perceived change in physical health, mental and emotional health, or sleep quality, from pre-lockdown levels. The results of the current study provide support for positive health benefits of spending time in a garden\u2014though associations may be bidirectional\u2014and suggest that domestic gardens could be a potential health resource during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "question": "I'm 24F. I literally just cannot get up no matter how much I tell my body to move. I spend several hours getting up from bed. When I, after hours, finally do manage to get up, my body is so, so heavy to carry around. I lose my vision/black out for several seconds after standing up and sometimes have to grab something in order not to fall, sometimes if it's really bad my arms start to spasm. Lifting my arms is hard. Brushing my teeth is hard. Taking a bath is hard and takes so long because it's hard to move around. When I breathe, it feels somehow like the air does not contain not oxygen for me.\n\nEven when lying down, I feel weak and do not recover from relaxing/lying down. It's like my muscles or whole body is kind of \"summing\" or tingling even when lying down.\n\nI also feel extremely cold all the time. I have dark circles under my eyes and am pale. Even when I use foundation and concealer, you can see my dark circles. I drink over 2 litres of water every day. I eat healthy - roasted vegetables and ground beef usually. I don't cook in oil or butter, just water. No candy. Almost never any bread. Lactose free milk. Eggs, smoothies. No seasoning except salt and very little pepper.\n\nMy BMI is currently around 17.3-17.7 (48-49 kgs/106-108 lbs, 167 cm/5'6\"), but I am trying to get it up by eating more, but it is difficult because I feel sick every time I eat  (chronic illness I've had for 15-16 years now) - it hurts/is painful, I lose all energy immediately, like out of the drain at once, I get nauseous, extremely bloated, feel a burning sensation in lower abdomen, I get water and food stuck in my throat several times a day and have to cough for several minutes sometimes, regurgitate the food up to seven hours after and therefore can't lie down in bed several hours after eating even though I'm depleted of energy, so I often fall down on my desk instead while sitting. Like in the movies.\n\nBecause of the exhaustion, just getting up and making/preparing food (and buying groceries) is a marathon itself, and often I lie hungry in bed but just cannot get up to get food because I'm so tired. Then I get even more tired, and it's even harder to get up. Sometimes I have to slide down from bed and onto the floor, sit there for a couple of minutes and then get up, black out for a couple of seconds, and finally drag my body to the fridge. Lol.\n\nWhen I finally do get up, I am not less tired. I am exactly as tired as lying down, just standing, and I of course get more tired from standing.\n\nI've done yoga the past five days despite having a cold (which has lasted since the 25nd of December 2020) because I really wanted to get stronger, but I feel completely done for during and after it and have experienced no extra energy. I have tried running for 3 weeks in a row before and felt the same. I am sort of afraid of exercising because it sometimes induces stomach pain, but have started yoga again now... before that I went for 30 min. - 1/2 hour walks every day, which is the best \"exercise\" I can do long-term without feeling pain. Even then I've walways felt tired during and after walks, often had old couples/ladies walking past me and so on.\n\nI take multi-vitamin pills. Blood tests confirmed D vitamin levels were fine, so were B and TSH levels. No gluten or lactose intolerance. I had pretty low iron levels however 1.5 years ago (was told if it went down with 0.5 units more, I would have needed blood transfusion) and got iron pills, however I had to stop because they made my stomach pain and constipation really bad. I am very scared to try them again, but I am taking some other iron supplements that are more natural-based but also very low in iron compared to actual iron tablets (200 mg a day). With the multi-vitamin pills, I get around 21mg a day. Along with that, I eat spinach, meat and green beans, beetroot, etc., i.e. high-iron food.\n\nI skip my period every second time with birth control. Since taking the pills, I have started to experience pretty bad period pain that I did not have before (which seems strange to me since they apparently often alleviate period pain?).\n\nAnyway this is how tired I feel despite eating healthy, drinking plenty of water, taking vitamins and iron supplements, doing exercise...\n\nWhat the fuck should I do at this point? I'm desperate for anything that actually works. I lose insane amounts of time to it, and it has made studying/socialising/doing anything extremely difficult... I just want a better life. A life that is not exhausting.\n\n**Edit:** thank you all so much for your suggestions and support, I am trying to research everything you mentioned and reply to all or most of you but there are so many comments, I really cannot believe so many people read this insanely long post lol.",
    "document": "Iron deficiency without anemia \u2013 a clinical challenge\nKey Clinical Message \n           One should always consider iron deficiency (without anemia) as the cause of persisting, unexplained unspecific, often severe, symptoms, regardless of the primary underlying disease. The symptoms of iron deficiency may arise from the metabolic systems where many proteins are iron containing. Long\u2010standing iron deficiency may be challenging to treat.",
    "response": "You should really see a psychiatrist in addition to a psychotherapist, physical therapist and dietician. You're not eating and probably anemic, which will make you weak. You're not eating because of your stomach issues. Your stomach issues don't sound like they are mostly organic but more predominantly psychosomatic. This has been going on for years, something will have shown up on testing and without treatment you would have had a catastrophic organ failure by now. That being said given the chronicity alone will cause you to have a mood disorder.\n\nSo simply this is a viscous cycle of predominantly psychosomatic issues that cause symptoms, that in turn cause malnutrition which adds/worsens symptoms,  which worsens the mood disorder, which then worsens the symptoms.... And the cycle continues with symptoms that worsen every couple of months, with the only objective testing showing malnutrition.\n\nHorrible place to be, very very difficult to get out of, but definitely not impossible. Just takes time, determination and the right professional help."

Our objective was to study the effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine and characterize the effect of waning immunity and whole-cell vaccine priming. \n           \n           \n             Methods: \n             We used the test-negative design, a nested case\u2013control study with test-negative individuals as controls. We constructed multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs). Vaccine effectiveness was calculated as (1 \u2013 OR) \u00d7 100. We assessed waning immunity by calculating the odds of developing pertussis per year since last vaccination and evaluated the relative effectiveness of priming with acellular versus whole-cell vaccine. \n           \n           \n             Results: \n             Between Dec. 7, 2009, and Mar. 31, 2013, data on 5867 individuals (486 test-positive cases and 5381 test-negative controls) were available for analysis. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 80% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71% to 86%) at 15\u2013364 days, 84% (95% CI 77% to 89%) at 1\u20133 years, 62% (95% CI 42% to 75%) at 4\u20137 years and 41% (95% CI 0% to 66%) at 8 or more years since last vaccination. We observed waning immunity with the acellular vaccine, with an adjusted OR for pertussis infection of 1.27 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.34) per year since last vaccination. Acellular, versus whole-cell, vaccine priming was associated with an increased odds of pertussis (adjusted OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.57). \n           \n           \n             Interpretation: \n             We observed high early effectiveness of the pertussis vaccine that rapidly declined as time since last vaccination surpassed 4 years, particularly with acellular vaccine priming. Considering whole-cell vaccine priming and/or boosters in pregnancy to optimize pertussis control may be prudent.",

Imaging showed torn hip labrums and hip impingement. However, the orthopedic surgeon I saw said hip labrum tears and hip impingement do not cause day-to-day pain and referred me to a psychiatrist, who assessed me and diagnosed me with histrionic personality disorder based on the orthopedic surgeon's assessment that my condition did not cause day to day pain. The psychiatrist said that I was exaggerating my pain to get attention, even though I told him I didn't like attention and that I genuinely was experiencing a lot of hip pain.

    "document": "Racial bias in pain assessment and treatment recommendations, and false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites\nSignificance \n           The present work examines beliefs associated with racial bias in pain management, a critical health care domain with well-documented racial disparities. Specifically, this work reveals that a substantial number of white laypeople and medical students and residents hold false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites and demonstrates that these beliefs predict racial bias in pain perception and treatment recommendation accuracy. It also provides the first evidence that racial bias in pain perception is associated with racial bias in pain treatment recommendations. Taken together, this work provides evidence that false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites continue to shape the way we perceive and treat black people\u2014they are associated with racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment recommendations. \n        \n           Black Americans are systematically undertreated for pain relative to white Americans. We examine whether this racial bias is related to false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites (e.g., \u201cblack people\u2019s skin is thicker than white people\u2019s skin\u201d). Study 1 documented these beliefs among white laypersons and revealed that participants who more strongly endorsed false beliefs about biological differences reported lower pain ratings for a black (vs. white) target. Study 2 extended these findings to the medical context and found that half of a sample of white medical students and residents endorsed these beliefs. Moreover, participants who endorsed these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient\u2019s pain as lower and made less accurate treatment recommendations. Participants who did not endorse these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient\u2019s pain as higher, but showed no bias in treatment recommendations. These findings suggest that individuals with at least some medical training hold and may use false beliefs about biological differences between blacks and whites to inform medical judgments, which may contribute to racial disparities in pain assessment and treatment.",

    "document": "Diagnosis and management of psoriasis\nAbstract \n           \n             Objective \n             To provide primary care clinicians with an up-to-date and practical overview of the diagnosis and management of psoriasis. \n           \n           \n             Quality of evidence \n             PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and observational studies about the diagnosis and management of psoriasis. \n           \n           \n             Main message \n             Psoriasis is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disease with predominantly skin and joint involvement. Beyond the physical dimensions of disease, psoriasis has an extensive emotional and psychosocial effect on patients, affecting social functioning and interpersonal relationships. As a disease of systemic inflammation, psoriasis is associated with multiple comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and malignancy. The diagnosis is primarily clinical and a skin biopsy is seldom required. Depending on the severity of disease, appropriate treatment can be initiated. For mild to moderate disease, first-line treatment involves topical therapies including corticosteroids, vitamin D3 analogues, and combination products. These topical treatments are efficacious and can be safely initiated and prescribed by primary care physicians. Patients with more severe and refractory symptoms might require further evaluation by a dermatologist for systemic therapy. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Many patients with psoriasis seek initial evaluation and treatment from their primary care providers. Recognition of psoriasis, as well as its associated medical and psychiatric comorbidities, would facilitate timely diagnosis and appropriate management with effective and safe topical therapies and other medical and psychological interventions, as needed. More severe and refractory cases might warrant referral to a dermatologist for further evaluation and possible systemic therapy.",

    "document": "Transient interference with staphylococcal quorum sensing blocks abscess formation\nThe staphylococcal virulon is controlled largely by the  agr  locus, a global accessory gene regulator that is autoinduced by a self-coded peptide (AIP) and is therefore a quorum sensor. The  agr  locus has diverged within and between species, giving rise to AIP variants that inhibit heterologous  agr  activation, an effect with therapeutic potential against  Staphylococcus aureus : a single dose of an inhibitory AIP blocks the formation of an experimental murine abscess. As the AIP is unstable at physiological pH, owing to its essential thiolactone bond, its single-dose efficacy seems paradoxical, which has led us to analyze the  in vivo  kinetics of  agr  activation and the consequences of its blockage by a heterologous AIP. Initially, the infecting bacteria grow rapidly, achieving sufficient population density within the first 3 h to activate  agr , and then enter a neutrophil-induced metabolic eclipse lasting for 2\u20133 d, followed by  agr  reactivation concomitantly with the development of the abscess. The inhibitory AIP prevents  agr  expression only during its short  in vivo  lifetime, suggesting that the  agr -induced and therefore quorum-dependent synthesis of virulence factors shortly after infection is necessary for the subsequent development of the abscess lesion and bacterial survival. We confirm this finding by showing that a sterile  agr +  supernatant causes a sterile abscess similar to the septic abscess caused by live bacteria. These results may provide a biological rationale for regulation of virulence factor expression by quorum sensing rather than by response to specific host signals.",

Long-known benefits of mRNA-based technologies consisting of relatively simple and fast engineering of mRNA encoding for antigens and proteins of interest, no genomic integration, and fast and efficient manufacturing process compared with other biologics have been verified, thus establishing a basis for a broad range of applications. The intrinsic immunogenicity of LNP formulated in vitro transcribed (IVT) mRNA is beneficial to the LNP-mRNA vaccines. However, avoiding immune activation is critical for therapeutic applications of LNP-mRNA for protein replacement where targeted mRNA expression and repetitive administration of high doses for a lifetime are required. This review summarizes our current understanding of immune activation induced by mRNA, IVT byproducts, and LNP.

    "document": "Neuropathic Itch\nChronic itch can be caused by dysfunctions of itch-sensing neurons that produce sensory hallucinations of pruritogenic stimuli. The cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unknown. All neurological disease categories have been implicated and neurological causes should be considered for patients with otherwise-unexplained itch. The same neurological illnesses that cause neuropathic pain can also or instead cause itch. These include shingles (particularly of the head or neck), small-fiber polyneuropathies, radiculopathies (e.g., notalgia paresthetica and brachioradial pruritis) and diverse lesions of the trigeminal nerve, root, and central tracts. Central nervous system lesions affecting sensory pathways, including strokes, multiple sclerosis, and cavernous hemangiomas can cause central itch. Neuropathic itch is a potent trigger of reflex and volitional scratching although this provides only fleeting relief. Rare patients whose lesion causes sensory loss as well as neuropathic itch can scratch deeply enough to cause painless self-injury. The most common location is on the face (trigeminal trophic syndrome). Treating neuropathic itch is difficult; antihistamines, corticosteroids, and most pain medications are largely ineffective. Current treatment recommendations include local or systemic administration of inhibitors of neuronal excitability (especially local anesthetics) and barriers to reduce scratching.",

    "question": "Female / 5'5\" / 99lbs / Caucasian \n\nI had a ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy under general anesthesia in the beginning of December, and was hospitalized overnight the following day for observation. I felt horrible from the moment I woke up from the procedure... extreme nausea despite a Zofran injection, then for the rest of the night into the next morning, vomiting, moving at all was pure hell, unable to keep anything down, headache, fever... a week later, my face and body remained swollen and I developed petechiae on my feet, and my palms were bright red and tender. It felt like the skin of my feet was just going to burst like a smashed tomato. Doctors I informed about this have just responded with \"that's weird\". At that time, the meds I was on were Flomax, Levaquin and Norco (plus Synthroid, Plaquenil, and Atenolol, my regular meds). I was also given two Heparin injections while in the hospital. A stent was placed that needed to remain for two weeks.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I had to undergo a second procedure because fragments were still left (even though I was told the first time that they got everything). I mentioned that the ultrasound from the hospital showed three fragments, and was told that the dust from the lasering can collect and appear as masses/calcifications. I am curious though as to why they didn't order another ultrasound before removing the first stent? Instead, the stent was removed, I continued to be miserable, and ended up having to have this second procedure to remove the fragments.\n\nI told the anesthesiologist about the difficulties prior, so they changed the anesthesia cocktail.\n\nSo here is where it gets a bit stressful: I woke up at some point and couldn't breathe. I was very aware of trying to get a breath and not being able to. I could hear voices saying \"breathe!\". I have no idea if this happened in the middle of surgery or coming out of it. Then, bam. I was out again and the next thing I knew, I was in the recovery room and fairly alert. \n\nIs this a common occurrence? What would cause this? \n\nOther info: A scopolamine patch was placed behind my ear prior to surgery this time. My throat is super sore and phlegmmy since yesterday. I know this is a common side effect post surgery, but I did not have any throat discomfort in December. Also, my body is pretty sore, especially in my left shoulder and right rib cage, as if I was being held down or something. It's unsettling to say the least.\n\nThe surgeon came in to tell me that he removed the remaining stones and that I would need to see him in a week to remove the new stent. He mentioned nothing about what I experienced, nor did I ask him because I was still foggy and just happy to be awake.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: I have an autoimmune disease as well as mitral valve prolapse. Since yesterday I have had an increase in palpitations and my heart rate is at 60 bpm. I know this is within normal range, but very abnormal for me. I have never seen my heart rate go below the mid 70s even while on Atenolol. Also, I did not take the Atenolol for either surgery since my BP was already running low. Is this lower heart rate a temporary side effect of the anesthesia or something else?\n\nAlso, after the first procedure I was peeing tons of blood for a little over a week. I did pass a pretty sizeable blood clot this time around with my first pee at home. Otherwise, my urine has been pale yellow and a bit cloudy with no blood... up until about an hour ago, and my urine is now pink. Is it weird to have delayed bleeding?",
    "document": "Anesthetic Requirement is Increased in Redheads\nBackground:  Age and body temperature alter inhalational anesthetic requirement; however, no human genotype is associated with inhalational anesthetic requirement. There is an anecdotal impression that anesthetic requirement is increased in redheads. Furthermore, red hair results from distinct mutations of the melanocortin-1 receptor. We thus tested the hypothesis that the requirement for the volatile anesthetic desflurane is greater in natural redhead than in dark-haired women. \n           Methods:  We studied healthy women with bright red (n=10) or dark (n=10) hair. Blood was sampled for subsequent analyses of melanocortin-1 receptor alleles. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane and maintained with desflurane randomly set at an end-tidal concentration between 5.5 and 7.5%. After an equilibration period, a noxious electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 70 mA) was transmitted through bilateral intradermal needles. If the volunteer moved in response to stimulation, desflurane was increased by 0.5%; otherwise it was decreased by 0.5%. This was continued until volunteers \u201ccrossed-over\u201d from movement to non-movement (or vice versa) four times. Individual logistic regression curves were used to determine desflurane requirement (P 50 ). Desflurane requirements in the two groups were compared using Mann-Whitney nonparametric two-sample test;  P  < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. \n           Results : The desflurane requirement in redheads (6.2 volume-percent [95% CI, 5.9 - 6.5]) was significantly greater than in dark-haired women (5.2 volume-percent [4.9 \u2013 5.5],  P  = 0.0004). Nine of 10 redheads were either homozygous or compound heterozygotes for mutations on the melanocortin-1 receptor gene. \n           Conclusions : Red hair appears to be a distinct phenotype linked to anesthetic requirement in humans that can also be traced to a specific genotype.",

    "document": "The pharmacology and toxicology of \u201cecstasy\u201d (MDMA) and related drugs\nAbtract \n           \"Ecstasy\" (MDMA) and related drugs are amphetamine derivatives that also have some of the pharmacological properties of mescaline. They have become popular with participants in \"raves,\" because they enhance energy, endurance, sociability and sexual arousal. This vogue among teenagers and young adults, together with the widespread belief that \"ecstasy\" is a safe drug, has led to a thriving illicit traffic in it. But these drugs also have serious toxic effects, both acute and chronic, that resemble those previously seen with other amphetamines and are caused by an excess of the same sympathomimetic actions for which the drugs are valued by the users. Neurotoxicity to the serotonergic system in the brain can also cause permanent physical and psychiatric problems. A detailed review of the literature has revealed over 87 \"ecstasy\"-related fatalities, caused by hyperpyrexia, rhabdomyolysis, intravascular coagulopathy, hepatic necrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, cerebrovascular accidents, and drug-related accidents or suicide. The toxic or even fatal dose range overlaps the range of recreational dosage.

    "response": "Sorry for your loss, I hope you and your family are getting the support you need.\n\nIf I understand you correctly, the lab that ran the toxicology says that up to 0.05 mg/L of MDMA are acceptable (the cut off), above that is abnormal. With a result of 2.94 mg/L and a cut off of 0.05, that would indicate a high level of MDMA in your mothers system, combined with a moderate quantity of alcohol.  \n\n\nEdit: I've done some reading, and the post mortem MDMA serum level seems to be quite variable dependent on site the blood is taken from. But, assuming the blood is a sample from a vein in an arm or leg, or mixed venous blood, a level of 2.9 seems to be more a moderate level. One study found levels up to 29mg/L. Given the variability in the levels i saw in some research, I would not be surprised if they can't say that a level of Xmg/L = Y tablets consumed, but this isn't my area.  \n\n\nAgain, sorry for your loss OP, I wish you all the best."

    "question": "63M, 6'2, 220, white,\n\nHealth Conditions: Severe sleep apnea, AFIB, coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure\n\nMedications: Valacyclovir, Eliquis, Dilitiazem, Ezetimbe, Atorvastatin, Finasteride\n\nLifestyle: Healthy diet; walked about 3 miles, 3-4x a week; drank alcohol daily (did not drink the day or night before his cardiac arrest)\n\nPrimary Complaint: I can provide more details as needed, but for the sake or brevity, my Dad died unexpectedly and suddenly. We were on vacation, and I woke up randomly at 5 am. After I woke up, I heard him snore and then doing sleep apnea type gasping breaths with pauses in between. I wasn't immediately concerned because I'd heard him breath like this before. After he was diagnosed with AFIB last year, he had a sleep study and was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. He received a CPAP but didn't use it because it was uncomfortable and he didn't think he needed it.\n\nHis gasps became more exagerated and farther apart, so I decided to try and wake him up. He didn't wake up, and that's when I started becoming concerned. I spent about 2 minutes trying to wake him up, progressively becoming more aggressive as I told him to wake up, turned on a light, turned on more lights, yelled at him, shook him, and finally threw water in his face. At some point in these 2 minutes, he stopped breathing. I don't exactly know when as my brain didn't even register it until 911 asked... I just know when I started trying to wake him up he was breathing and when I called 911, his chest was still.\n\nHe was asleep on his side curled up in the fetal position with his head propped onto his elbow as a pillow. He looked like he had been in that position for a long time. His brow was slightly furrowed and his face was red. Somehow his face was also a little... gray? I can't describe it because his face was predominantly red, but it also had a grayish tinge somehow\n\nI called 911 after trying to wake him up for 2 minutes and ran to the hotel lobby. In an act of god, there were 2 surgeons standing there who immediately jumped into action. One ran upstairs with me to start CPR and the other got a CPR kit and administered an oral airway. This was only like 2 minutes after I called 911. Like a minute later, the police arrived and the surgeons yelled to tell the EMTs to bring oxygen. Like a minute later the EMTs arrived and attached the AED and shocked him several times. After a few minutes, the police pulled me away, but I know he experienced both ventricular fibrillation and pulseless electrical activity. After 30 minutes, they got a heart beat and we went to the hospital in an ambulance.\n\nThe hospital couldn't find any clear reason he went into cardiac arrest. We are almost positive he had no symptoms because the night before we were planning the 6 mile hike we'd do the next day. As a result, their hypothesis of his cause of death is almost entirely based on my testimony. I actually made a really clear and accurate timestamped timeline using my phone data from between when I woke up until when we got to the ER, which is why I know my timeline is correct despite me being in shock.\n\nThe prevailing theory was that his cardiac arrest was caused by his untreated sleep apnea. Since he still seemed to be breathing when I was trying to wake him up but he wouldn't wake up, the ICU doctor thought he had already experienced low oxygen throughout the night and was already experiencing hypoxia, hence why the quick intervention from me, the surgeons, and the EMTs wasn't enough to prevent a severe anoxic brain injury. After 5 days in the ICU, we removed life support once an MRI confirmed he would not recover.\n\nMy Question:\nI just don't understand. Isn't the whole point of sleep apnea that your brain wakes you up when your oxygen gets too low? I can't find any sources online referencing sleep apnea causing respiratory arrest or a patient to fall into a coma from low oxygen. There are no exacerbating factors that we can identify. He didn't drink that night and the altitude wasn't high enough to be a factor.\n\nI also read online about agonal breathing during cardiac arrests. Maybe that's what I heard and the cardiac arrest happened earlier than just when he \"stopped breathing?\" However, my uncle is a cardiologist and said he thought the breathing patten I described lasted too long to be agonal breathing.\n\nWhat happened? Can anyone answer or provide any insight?\n\nI know there are no clear answers but I went to sleep excited to go hiking and kayaking with my Dad and I woke up and he didn't.\n\nI've also been obsessing over his FitBit data. It shows that in the months before, his heart rate sometimes dropped very low in his sleep (as low as 29) and then would jump up to 90 or 100. My Uncle indicated that this fits with sleep apnea. His FitBit also often noted high oxygen variation in his sleep, but I guess his sleep study already told us that. I also think maybe his AFIB wasn't controlled but he wasn't symptomatic because he has random spikes in HR.\n\nThank you very much for reading and for all you do.",
    "document": "Sleep Apnea and Sudden Cardiac Death\nSleep plays an integral role in maintaining health and quality of life. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep disorder recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and arrhythmia. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a common and devastating event. Out-of-hospital SCD accounts for the majority of deaths from cardiac disease, which is the leading cause of death globally. A limited but emerging body of research has further elaborated on the link between OSA and SCD. In this article, we aim to provide a critical review of the existing evidence by addressing the following questions: (1) what epidemiologic evidence exists linking OSA to SCD; (2) what evidence exists for a pathophysiologic connection between OSA and SCD; (3) are there electrocardiographic markers of SCD found in patients with OSA; (4) does heart failure represent a major effect modifier regarding the relationship between OSA and SCD; and (5) what is the impact of sleep apnea treatment on SCD and cardiovascular outcomes. Finally, we elaborate on ongoing research to enhance our understanding of the OSA-SCD association.",
    "response": "Sorry for your loss.\n\nUnfortunately, untreated sleep apnea has been a well documented risk factor for various cardiac problems like heart disease, atrial fibrillation, including sudden cardiac death (SCD), especially if it\u2019s not treated.\n\nGenerally, when patients are usually having apenic episodes they don\u2019t always necessarily wake up during these periods. Initially they may due to constant changes in pressure jolting around in their chest between the apenic episodes with associated hypoxia. Additionally, these constant pressure changes or increases in their chest during apnea is usually what causes their heart rates to dip down into the low 30\u2019s, which of course most heart rates that low aren\u2019t good and ultimately increases the risk for various cardiac dysrhythmias to occur like pauses that can eventually lead to SCD.\n\nOtherwise, if the condition continues to go untreated and with continued episodes of apnea / hypoxia, your bodies, brain, heart, and lungs are going to eventually remodel themselves and adjust to this. Hence, why we notice that even though untreated sleep apnea patients from our perspective may look like their sleeping all night, is usually why they\u2019re so groggy / lethargic throughout the days sometimes, especially as they\u2019re majorly hypoxic throughout the night, which obviously isn\u2019t good. \n\nAgain sorry for your loss but I hope this helped some. \n\n[Sleep Apnea and SCD]("

Its incidence has increased in recent years. The objective of this study was to review all the cases of PRH in a tertiary care teaching hospital over three years (January 2017-December 2019) to determine its incidence and analyse clinico-demographic characteristics in these women. \n           Method \n           All women undergoing PRH from January 2017 to December 2019 were included in the study. Data were collected retrospectively from medical records, of patients who underwent a PRH at the time of delivery, or within 24 hours, or performed any time before discharge from the same hospitalization and obstetric event. The total number of deliveries including caesarean and vaginal deliveries were recorded. Main outcome measures were the incidence of PRH, indication for hysterectomy, management option used, maternal outcomes (PPH, bladder injury and maternal death) and fetal outcomes (stillbirth). \n           Results \n           There were a total of 3904,4 deliveries; 27,337 vaginal and 11,697 caesarean sections in three years. A total of 50 patients underwent a PRH. The incidence of PRH in our study was 1.3 per 1,000 deliveries and 3.5/1,000 caesareans, respectively. PRH was found to be more common following cesarean sections than vaginal deliveries (odds ratio 22.86 [95% CI: 8.16\u00a0to\u00a063.98]). Morbid adherent placenta (MAP) (n=30, 62%) was the most common indications of PRH. Seven (15%) women had PRH due to uterine rupture. Twenty-seven women of the 30 women (90%) with the MAP\u00a0had a previous caesarean delivery. The case fatality rate per hysterectomy was 4%. Stillbirth rate (SBR: n=8,16%) among women having PRH was seven-fold higher than overall SBR in our country. \n           Conclusion \n           There has been a rise in MAP as an indication of PRH in our study for a decade in comparison to uterine atony. Caesarean delivery is a significant risk factor for PRH. Previous caesarean section and major placenta previa were common occurring obstetric risk factors present in the MAP in our cohort.\u00a0Our maternal mortality in PRH was low and the stillbirth rate was high when compared with national data.",

    "document": "Biological relevance of ZNF224 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication IN NF-kB pathway regulation\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, whose presentation and clinical course are highly variable. Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",

    "document": "Effect of vitamin D3 on production of progesterone in porcine granulosa cells by regulation of steroidogenic enzymes\nAbstract \n           1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3), an active form of Vitamin D, is photosynthesized in the skin of vertebrates in response to solar ultraviolet B radiation (UV-B). VD3 deficiency can cause health problems such as immune disease, metabolic disease, and bone disorders. It has also been demonstrated that VD3 is involved in reproductive functions. Female sex hormones such as estrogen and progesterone are biosynthesized mainly in ovarian granulosa cells as the ovarian follicle develops. The functions of sex hormones include regulation of the estrus cycle and puberty as well as maintenance of pregnancy in females. In this study, we isolated granulosa cells from porcine ovaries and cultured them for experiments. To examine the effects of VD3 on ovarian granulosa cells, the mRNA and protein levels of genes were analyzed by Real-time PCR and Western blotting assay. Production of progesterone from granulosa cells was also measured by ELISA assay. As a result, transcriptional and translational regulation of progesterone biosynthesis-related genes in granulosa cells was significantly altered by VD3. Furthermore, progesterone concentrations in porcine granulosa cell-cultured media decreased in response to VD3. These results show that VD3 was a strong regulator of sex steroid hormone production in porcine granulosa cells, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency may result in inappropriate sexual development of industrial animals and eventually economic loss.",

Triplanar tarsometatarsal (TMT) arthrodesis achieves this by three-dimensional correction of the deformity. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in bony and soft tissue width in patients undergoing triplanar TMT arthrodesis. \n           \n           \n             Methods: \n             After receiving IRB approval, charts were retrospectively reviewed for patients undergoing triplanar TMT arthrodesis for hallux valgus deformity at four institutions between 2016 and 2019. Patients who underwent concomitant first metatarsal head osteotomies (e.g., Silver or Chevron) or fifth metatarsal osteotomies were excluded. Preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior weightbearing radiographs were compared to evaluate for changes in bony and soft tissue width. Bony width was defined as the distance from the most medial aspect of the first metatarsal head to the most lateral aspect of the fifth metatarsal head. Soft tissue width was defined as the distance from the most medial soft tissue overlying the first metatarsal head to the most lateral soft tissue overlying the fifth metatarsal head. \n           \n           \n             Results: \n             148 feet from 144 patients (48.1 +- 15.7 years, 92.5% male) met inclusion criteria. Preoperative osseous foot width was 96.2 mm, compared to 85.8 mm postoperative (p < 0.001). Preoperative soft tissue width was 106.6 mm, compared to 99.3 mm postoperative (p < 0.001).

Many imaging-based degenerative features are likely part of normal aging and unassociated with pain. \n        \n           \n             BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: \n             Degenerative changes are commonly found in spine imaging but often occur in pain-free individuals as well as those with back pain. We sought to estimate the prevalence, by age, of common degenerative spine conditions by performing a systematic review studying the prevalence of spine degeneration on imaging in asymptomatic individuals. \n           \n           \n             MATERIALS AND METHODS: \n             We performed a systematic review of articles reporting the prevalence of imaging findings (CT or MR imaging) in asymptomatic individuals from published English literature through April 2014. Two reviewers evaluated each manuscript. We selected age groupings by decade (20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years), determining age-specific prevalence estimates. For each imaging finding, we fit a generalized linear mixed-effects model for the age-specific prevalence estimate clustering in the study, adjusting for the midpoint of the reported age interval. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS: \n             Thirty-three articles reporting imaging findings for 3110 asymptomatic individuals met our study inclusion criteria. The prevalence of disk degeneration in asymptomatic individuals increased from 37% of 20-year-old individuals to 96% of 80-year-old individuals. Disk bulge prevalence increased from 30% of those 20 years of age to 84% of those 80 years of age. Disk protrusion prevalence increased from 29% of those 20 years of age to 43% of those 80 years of age.

    "question": "I know the general consensus is to have sunscreen but my sister's gp said that 20mins unprotected in the sun with as much of the body exposed is good for vitamin d. Are there any studies to back this up?\n\n24\n\nMale",
    "document": "Sunlight and Vitamin D\nVitamin D is the sunshine vitamin that has been produced on this earth for more than 500 million years. During exposure to sunlight 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin absorbs UV B radiation and is converted to previtamin D3 which in turn isomerizes into vitamin D3. Previtamin D3 and vitamin D3 also absorb UV B radiation and are converted into a variety of photoproducts some of which have unique biologic properties. Sun induced vitamin D synthesis is greatly influenced by season, time of day, latitude, altitude, air pollution, skin pigmentation, sunscreen use, passing through glass and plastic, and aging. Vitamin D is metabolized sequentially in the liver and kidneys into 25-hydroxyvitamin D which is a major circulating form and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D which is the biologically active form respectively. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D plays an important role in regulating calcium and phosphate metabolism for maintenance of metabolic functions and for skeletal health. Most cells and organs in the body have a vitamin D receptor and many cells and organs are able to produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. As a result 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D influences a large number of biologic pathways which may help explain association studies relating vitamin D deficiency and living at higher latitudes with increased risk for many chronic diseases including autoimmune diseases, some cancers, cardiovascular disease, infectious disease, schizophrenia and type 2 diabetes. A three-part strategy of increasing food fortification programs with vitamin D, sensible sun exposure recommendations and encouraging ingestion of a vitamin D supplement when needed should be implemented to prevent global vitamin D deficiency and its negative health consequences.",

Results of a randomized controlled trial.\nMarks R1, Foley PA, Jolley D, Knight KR, Harrison J, Thompson SC.\nAuthor information\nAbstract\nBACKGROUND AND DESIGN:\nStudies published have suggested a possibility that regular use of sunscreen to prevent skin cancer may put the population, particularly elderly people, at risk of vitamin D deficiency. We aimed to determine whether regular use of sunscreens in the normal adult population, as recommended by public health authorities for the prevention of skin cancer, may put individuals at risk of vitamin D deficiency. A randomized double-blind control trial of the daily use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen (sun protection factor [SPF] 17) vs placebo cream over a summer period in Australia was conducted in 113 people aged 40 years and over, with sampling stratified by age. All participants had at least one solar keratosis. Serum samples taken at the beginning and at the end of the study were analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.\n\nRESULTS:\nMean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 rose significantly by the same amount in both groups over the period of the study (placebo, +12.8 mmol/L; sunscreen, +11.8 mmol/L). Mean levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased significantly in the placebo group only (placebo, +10.8 pmol/L; sunscreen, +1.3 pmol/L), but for no subject in either group was the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 outside the reference range either at the start or at the end of the study. There were no significant differences by age, sex, and skin type in the change in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 over the study period.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nNo person, including those aged 70 years and over, developed any vitamin D levels outside the normal reference range during the period of the study. The data suggest that over an Australian summer sufficient sunlight is received, probably through both the sunscreen itself and the lack of total skin cover at all times, to allow adequate vitamin D production in people who are recommended to use sunscreens regularly. More work is required to elucidate the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, particularly during the different seasons of the year."

Serum samples taken at the beginning and at the end of the study were analyzed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.\n\nRESULTS:\nMean levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 rose significantly by the same amount in both groups over the period of the study (placebo, +12.8 mmol/L; sunscreen, +11.8 mmol/L). Mean levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased significantly in the placebo group only (placebo, +10.8 pmol/L; sunscreen, +1.3 pmol/L), but for no subject in either group was the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 outside the reference range either at the start or at the end of the study. There were no significant differences by age, sex, and skin type in the change in 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 over the study period.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nNo person, including those aged 70 years and over, developed any vitamin D levels outside the normal reference range during the period of the study. The data suggest that over an Australian summer sufficient sunlight is received, probably through both the sunscreen itself and the lack of total skin cover at all times, to allow adequate vitamin D production in people who are recommended to use sunscreens regularly. More work is required to elucidate the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, particularly during the different seasons of the year."

Eligible participants were active-duty US service members aged 18 to 50 years with low back pain from a musculoskeletal source. \n           \n           \n             Interventions \n             The intervention period was 6 weeks. Usual medical care included self-care, medications, physical therapy, and pain clinic referral. Chiropractic care included spinal manipulative therapy in the low back and adjacent regions and additional therapeutic procedures such as rehabilitative exercise, cryotherapy, superficial heat, and other manual therapies. \n           \n           \n             Main Outcomes and Measures \n             Coprimary outcomes were low back pain intensity (Numerical Rating Scale; scores ranging from 0 [no low back pain] to 10 [worst possible low back pain]) and disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire; scores ranging from 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater disability) at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes included perceived improvement, satisfaction (Numerical Rating Scale; scores ranging from 0 [not at all satisfied] to 10 [extremely satisfied]), and medication use. The coprimary outcomes were modeled with linear mixed-effects regression over baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, and 12. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Of the 806 screened patients who were recruited through either clinician referrals or self-referrals, 750 were enrolled (250 at each site). The mean (SD) participant age was 30.9 (8.7) years, 175 participants (23.3%) were female, and 243 participants (32.4%) were nonwhite. Statistically significant site\u2009\u00d7\u2009time\u2009\u00d7\u2009group interactions were found in all models. Adjusted mean differences in scores at week 6 were statistically significant in favor of usual medical care plus chiropractic care compared with usual medical care alone overall for low back pain intensity (mean difference, \u22121.1; 95% CI, \u22121.4 to \u22120.7), disability (mean difference, \u22122.2; 95% CI, \u22123.1 to \u22121.2), and satisfaction (mean difference, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.1 to 2.8) as well as at each site. Adjusted odd ratios at week 6 were also statistically significant in favor of usual medical care plus chiropractic care overall for perceived improvement (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.18; 95% CI, 0.13-0.25) and self-reported pain medication use (odds ratio\u2009=\u20090.73; 95% CI, 0.54-0.97). No serious related adverse events were reported. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions and Relevance \n             Chiropractic care, when added to usual medical care, resulted in moderate short-term improvements in low back pain intensity and disability in active-duty military personnel. This trial provides additional support for the inclusion of chiropractic care as a component of multidisciplinary health care for low back pain, as currently recommended in existing guidelines. However, study limitations illustrate that further research is needed to understand longer-term outcomes as well as how patient heterogeneity and intervention variations affect patient responses to chiropractic care. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:  NCT01692275 \n           \n        \n           Key Points \n           \n             Question \n             What is the effect of adding chiropractic care to usual medical care for patients with low back pain? \n           \n           \n             Findings \n             In this comparative effectiveness clinical trial among active-duty US military personnel, patients who received usual medical care plus chiropractic care reported a statistically significant moderate improvement in low back pain intensity and disability at 6 weeks compared with those who received usual care alone. \n           \n           \n             Meaning \n             This trial supports the inclusion of chiropractic care as a component of multidisciplinary health care for low back pain, as currently recommended in existing guidelines. \n           \n        \n           This clinical trial compares the effects of chiropractic care added to usual medical care vs usual medical care alone on pain relief and pain-related function among active-duty US military personnel.",

    "document": "Effectiveness and Economic Evaluation of Chiropractic Care for the Treatment of Low Back Pain: A Systematic Review of Pragmatic Studies\nBackground Context \n             Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and among the most common reasons for seeking primary sector care. Chiropractors, physical therapists and general practitioners are among those providers that treat LBP patients, but there is only limited evidence regarding the effectiveness and economic evaluation of care offered by these provider groups. \n           \n           \n             Purpose \n             To estimate the clinical effectiveness and to systematically review the literature of full economic evaluation of chiropractic care compared to other commonly used care approaches among adult patients with non-specific LBP. \n           \n           \n             Study Design \n             Systematic reviews of interventions and economic evaluations. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             A comprehensive search strategy was conducted to identify 1) pragmatic randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and/or 2) full economic evaluations of chiropractic care for low back pain compared to standard care delivered by other healthcare providers. Studies published between 1990 and 4 th  June 2015 were considered. Primary outcomes included pain, functional status and global improvement. Study selection, critical quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. Data from RCTs with low risk of bias were included in a meta-analysis to determine effect estimates. Cost estimates of full economic evaluations were converted to 2015 USD and results summarized using Slavin\u2019s qualitative best-evidence synthesis. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Six RCTs and three full economic evaluations were scientifically admissible. Five RCTs with low risk of bias compared chiropractic care to exercise therapy (n = 1), physical therapy (n = 3) and medical care (n = 1). Overall, we found similar effects for chiropractic care and the other types of care and no reports of serious adverse events. Three low to high quality full economic evaluations studies (one cost-effectiveness, one cost-minimization and one cost-benefit) compared chiropractic to medical care. Given the divergent conclusions (favours chiropractic, favours medical care, equivalent options), mixed-evidence was found for economic evaluations of chiropractic care compared to medical care. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Moderate evidence suggests that chiropractic care for LBP appears to be equally effective as physical therapy. Limited evidence suggests the same conclusion when chiropractic care is compared to exercise therapy and medical care although no firm conclusion can be reached at this time. No serious adverse events were reported for any type of care. Our review was also unable to clarify whether chiropractic or medical care is more cost-effective. Given the limited available evidence, the decision to seek or to refer patients for chiropractic care should be based on patient preference and values. Future studies are likely to have an important impact on our estimates as these were based on only a few admissible studies.",

Of the 8119 abstracts related to modifying factors, 15 relevant articles, including three meta-analyses, were included. We used fixed-effects inverse-variance models on the logarithmic scale to obtain updated estimates of certain transmission risks using data from primary studies, and employed Poisson regression to calculate relative risks with exact 95% confidence intervals for certain modifying factors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Risk of HIV transmission was greatest for blood transfusion, followed by vertical exposure, sexual exposures, and other parenteral exposures.

    "document": "Neuropathic Itch\nChronic itch can be caused by dysfunctions of itch-sensing neurons that produce sensory hallucinations of pruritogenic stimuli. The cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unknown. All neurological disease categories have been implicated and neurological causes should be considered for patients with otherwise-unexplained itch. The same neurological illnesses that cause neuropathic pain can also or instead cause itch. These include shingles (particularly of the head or neck), small-fiber polyneuropathies, radiculopathies (e.g., notalgia paresthetica and brachioradial pruritis) and diverse lesions of the trigeminal nerve, root, and central tracts. Central nervous system lesions affecting sensory pathways, including strokes, multiple sclerosis, and cavernous hemangiomas can cause central itch. Neuropathic itch is a potent trigger of reflex and volitional scratching although this provides only fleeting relief. Rare patients whose lesion causes sensory loss as well as neuropathic itch can scratch deeply enough to cause painless self-injury. The most common location is on the face (trigeminal trophic syndrome). Treating neuropathic itch is difficult; antihistamines, corticosteroids, and most pain medications are largely ineffective. Current treatment recommendations include local or systemic administration of inhibitors of neuronal excitability (especially local anesthetics) and barriers to reduce scratching.",

The aqueous extract of the fern  Polypodium leucotomos  (PLE), Fernblock \u00ae  (IFC, Madrid, Spain), has demonstrated antioxidant and photoprotective activities and has been used for the treatment of several pigmentary disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral PLE in the treatment of melasma in Asian patients.  Methods:  Forty healthy adult patients with clinical diagnoses of melasma who were receiving treatment with topical 4% hydroquinone cream and sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 50+ were recruited for inclusion in this study from the National Skin Centre in Singapore. They were randomized to receive either oral PLE supplementation or placebo for 12 weeks. Patients were assessed at baseline, Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 using the modified Melasma Area and Severity Index (mMASI); melanin and erythema indexes; VISIA \u00ae  photography (Canfield Scientific, Parsippany, New Jersey, USA); and the Melasma Quality of Life (MelasQoL) questionnaire. Adverse events were recorded.  Results:  Following four, eight, and 12 weeks of treatment, there were statistically significant differences between the mMASI scores of both groups as compared with the baseline scores ( p \u22640.01). mMASI scores of the PLE group at eight and 12 weeks were also significantly lower than those of the placebo group ( p \u22640.05). At the end of the study, a significant improvement was reached in both groups (both  p \u22640.01), with no significant differences between them. The scores of the melanin and erythema indices displayed a slight improvement in both groups, without significant differences among them. MelasQoL score showed an improvement in the PLE group versus the placebo group. Our results demonstrate that the PLE aqueous extract product significantly improves and accelerates the outcome reached with hydroquinone and sunscreen almost from the first month of treatment in comparison with the placebo. There were no significant side effects reported.  Conclusions:  The oral PLE aqueous extract product appears to be a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for melasma in combination with topical hydroquinone and sunscreen.",

    "document": "Calorie restriction induces reversible lymphopenia and lymphoid organ atrophy due to cell redistribution\nCalorie restriction (CR) without malnutrition increases life span and health span in multiple model organisms. In non-human and human primates, CR causes changes that protect against several age-related pathologies, reduces inflammation, and preserves or improves cell-mediated immunity. However, CR has also been shown to exhibit adverse effects on certain organs and systems, including the immune system, and to impact genetically different organisms of the same species differentially. Alternately, short periods of fasting followed by refeeding may result in the proliferation of bone marrow stem cells, suggesting a potential rejuvenation effect that could impact the hematopoietic compartment. However, the global consequences of CR followed by refeeding on the immune system have not been carefully investigated. Here, we show that individuals practicing long-term CR with adequate nutrition have markedly lower circulating levels of total leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In 10-month-old mice, short-term CR lowered lymphocyte cellularity in multiple lymphoid tissues, but not in bone marrow, which appears to be a site of influx, or a \u201csafe haven\u201d for B, NK, and T cells during CR. Cellular loss and redistribution was reversed within the first week of refeeding. Based on BrdU incorporation and Ki67 expression assays, repopulating T cells exhibited high proliferation in the refeeding group following CR. Finally, we demonstrated that the thymus was not essential for T cell repopulation following refeeding. These findings are of potential relevance to strategies to rejuvenate the immune system in mammals and warrant further investigation. \n           \n             Electronic supplementary material \n             The online version of this article (10.1007/s11357-018-0022-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",
    "response": "1. WBC can be low for many reasons: bone marrow suppression from toxins (e.g. alcohol, medications), acute illness (e.g. viral syndromes, sepsis) or more rarely bone marrow processes (leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, generally bad stuff). In all comers, the last group is much less likely to be the culprit than the first two, just in case you're getting worried.\n2. Alk phos being low is generally not something to worry about. On medicine board tests they love to mention the association of low alk phos with Wilson's disease, but that is not the cause in the vast majority of people. Zinc and magnesium levels seem to correlate with alk phos, but not in any way that should affect management decisions to my knowledge. Low bone turnover (bones are constantly degrading and rebuilding) could also be a cause of low alk phos, though once again, would not affect a patient's management to my knowledge.\n3. There are many anemias beyond iron deficiency. You need more than just the Hgb level to sort that out. MCV and RDW from your CBC would be helpful, along with the iron level, TIBC, ferritin and %sat. Depending on those tests you can go down various paths of additional testing (or stop there if you think you have a culprit)."

    "document": "Scaphoid tubercle tenderness: a better indicator of scaphoid fractures?\nTenderness in the anatomical snuff box (ASB) has long been accepted as an indicator of a possible scaphoid fracture. The longitudinal axis of the scaphoid lies in an anteroposterior plane, perpendicular to the remainder of the carpal bones, in the radially deviated wrist. The scaphoid tubercle can therefore be easily and accurately palpated on the palmar aspect of the radially deviated wrist. This study was devised to determine if tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle (ST) was superior to ASB tenderness in identifying definite fractures. Over a 10-month period 246 patients were seen who were suspected of having a scaphoid injury. Thirty (12%) were eventually proven to have definite fracture. Tenderness in the ASB had a sensitivity rate of 90% (95% confidence limits 80-100%) and specificity of 40% (33-47%) as an indicator of a definite fracture. ST tenderness had a sensitivity of 87% (75-99%) and specificity of 57% (50-64%). There is therefore no significant difference in the sensitivity between ASB and ST tenderness but ST tenderness is significantly more specific. However, the presence of either ASB or ST tenderness should be used in order to identify all fractures.

    "document": "Suppression of RhoG activity is mediated by a syndecan 4\u2013synectin\u2013RhoGDI1 complex and is reversed by PKC\u03b1 in a Rac1 activation pathway\nFibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is a major regulator of developmental, pathological, and therapeutic angiogenesis. Its activity is partially mediated by binding to syndecan 4 (S4), a proteoglycan receptor. Angiogenesis requires polarized activation of the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac1, which involves localized dissociation from RhoGDI1 and association with the plasma membrane. Previous work has shown that genetic deletion of S4 or its adapter, synectin, leads to depolarized Rac activation, decreased endothelial migration, and other physiological defects. In this study, we show that Rac1 activation downstream of S4 is mediated by the RhoG activation pathway. RhoG is maintained in an inactive state by RhoGDI1, which is found in a ternary complex with synectin and S4. Binding of S4 to synectin increases the latter's binding to RhoGDI1, which in turn enhances RhoGDI1's affinity for RhoG. S4 clustering activates PKC\u03b1, which phosphorylates RhoGDI1 at Ser 96 . This phosphorylation triggers release of RhoG, leading to polarized activation of Rac1. Thus, FGF2-induced Rac1 activation depends on the suppression of RhoG by a previously uncharacterized ternary S4\u2013synectin\u2013RhoGDI1 protein complex and activation via PKC\u03b1.",

The findings support evidence-based guidelines to avoid MRI for acute back pain during the first month except for \u201cred flag\u201d indications. \n        \n           \n             Study Design. \n             Retrospective cohort study. \n           \n           \n             Objective. \n             To determine the effect of early (receipt \u226430 d postonset) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on disability and medical cost outcomes in patients with acute, disabling, work-related low back pain (LBP) with and without radiculopathy. \n           \n           \n             Summary of Background Data. \n             Evidence-based guidelines suggest that, except for \u201cred flags,\u201d MRI is indicated to evaluate patients with persistent radicular pain, after 1 month of conservative management, who are candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injections. Prior research has suggested an independent iatrogenic effect of nonindicated early MRI, but it had limited clinical information and/or patient populations. \n           \n           \n             Methods. \n             A nationally representative sample of workers with acute, disabling, occupational LBP was randomly selected, oversampling those with radiculopathy diagnoses (N = 1000). Clinical information from medical reports was used to exclude cases for which early MRI might have been indicated, or MRI occurred more than 30 days postonset (final cohort = 555). Clinical information was also used to categorize cases into \u201cnonspecific LBP\u201d and \u201cradiculopathy\u201d groups and further divided into \u201cearly-MRI\u201d and \u201cno-MRI\u201d subgroups. The Cox proportional hazards model examined the association of early MRI with duration of the first episode of disability. Multivariate linear regression models examined the association with medical costs. All models adjusted for demographic and medical severity measures. \n           \n           \n             Results. \n             In our sample, 37% of the nonspecific LBP and 79.9% of the radiculopathy cases received early MRI. The early-MRI groups had similar outcomes regardless of radiculopathy status: much lower rates of going off disability and, on average, $12,948 to $13,816 higher medical costs than the no-MRI groups. Even in a subgroup with relatively minimal disability impact (\u226430 d of total lost time post-MRI), medical costs were, on average, $7643 to $8584 higher in the early-MRI groups. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion. \n             Early MRI without indication has a strong iatrogenic effect in acute LBP, regardless of radiculopathy status. Providers and patients should be made aware that when early MRI is not indicated, it provides no benefits, and worse outcomes are likely. \n             Level of Evidence:  3",

    "document": "Co-application of ACC-deaminase producing PGPR and timber-waste biochar improves pigments formation, growth and yield of wheat under drought stress\nBesides other deleterious effects, drought elevates ethylene level too in plants. Increased ethylene concentration reduces root elongation and development that consequently retard plant growth and yield. There are certain PGPR which produce ACC-deaminase. The ACC-deaminase converts ACC (an immediate precursor of ethylene biosynthesis in methionine pathway in higher plants) into ammonia and \u03b1-ketobutyrate instead of ethylene. Regularization of ethylene level in plants mitigate the effects of drought. On the other hand, biochar has been reported to be rich in nutrients and exhibiting higher water holding capacity. So, a pot study was conducted with the hypothesis that the combined application of ACC-deaminase producing PGPR and biochar would minimize the drought effects on wheat growth. The ACC-deaminase producing PGPR were applied on wheat seeds in combination with two biochar doses. Three moisture levels were maintained throughout the trial.

You said your MRI did not show anything which is usually the first step to rule out an actual brain tumor (which can cause increased pressure on the brain, migraines, etc). From here, the next step is a Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap) to measure the opening pressure of your cerebral spinal fluid. Once they confirm the condition, they might put you on a medication to suppress CSF production such as Topamax or Acetazolamide. I would consult with your primary doctor and make this suggestion to them. Hope you get this figured out!\n\nedit: Also the static in your vision may also play a key role.

    "document": "Is there a place for cellular therapy in depression?\nAlthough efforts have been made to improve the pharmacological treatment of depression, approximately one-third of patients with depression do not respond to conventional therapy using antidepressants. Other potential non-pharmacological therapies have been studied in the last years, including the use of mesenchymal stem cell therapies to treat depression. These therapies are reviewed here since it is clinically relevant to develop innovative therapeutics to treat psychiatric patients. Experimental data corroborate that mesenchymal stem cell therapy could be considered a potential treatment for depression based on its anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic properties. However, some clinical trials involving treatment of depression with stem cells are in progress, but with no published results. These studies and other future clinical investigations will be crucial to define how much mesenchymal stem cells can effectively be used in psychiatric clinics as a strategy for supporting depression treatment.",
    "response": "Stem cell treatment for mental health conditions is not approved or well-studied, and is in the VERY early stages of testing in humans. We don\u2019t know if it works at all and we don\u2019t know what the potential dangers are.\n\nIf you meet the criteria for a clinical trial testing this, it\u2019s certainly an option.

    "document": "A low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet reduces blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats without deleterious changes in insulin resistance\nPrevious studies reported that diets high in simple carbohydrates could increase blood pressure in rodents. We hypothesized that the converse, a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet, might reduce blood pressure. Six-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR;  n  = 54) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY;  n  = 53, normotensive control) were fed either a control diet (C; 10% fat, 70% carbohydrate, 20% protein) or a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet (HF; 20% carbohydrate, 60% fat, 20% protein). After 10 wk, SHR-HF had lower ( P  < 0.05) mean arterial pressure than SHR-C (148 \u00b1 3 vs. 159 \u00b1 3 mmHg) but a similar degree of cardiac hypertrophy (33.4 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 33.1 \u00b1 0.4 heart weight/tibia length, mg/mm). Mesenteric arteries and the entire aorta were used to assess vascular function and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) signaling, respectively. Endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine) relaxation of mesenteric arteries was improved ( P  < 0.05) in SHR-HF vs. SHR-C, whereas contraction (potassium chloride, phenylephrine) was reduced ( P  < 0.05). Phosphorylation of eNOS Ser1177  increased ( P  < 0.05) in arteries from SHR-HF vs. SHR-C. Plasma glucose, insulin, and homoeostatic model of insulin assessment were lower ( P  < 0.05) in SHR-HF vs. SHR-C, whereas peripheral insulin sensitivity (insulin tolerance test) was similar. After a 10-h fast, insulin stimulation (2 U/kg ip) increased ( P  < 0.05) phosphorylation of Akt Ser473  and S6 in heart and gastrocnemius similarly in SHR-C vs. SHR-HF. In conclusion, a low-carbohydrate/high-fat diet reduced blood pressure and improved arterial function in SHR without producing signs of insulin resistance or altering insulin-mediated signaling in the heart, skeletal muscle, or vasculature.",

In a previous small pilot study, it was found that a low carbohydrate diet was associated with significant improvements in blood pressure, weight, \u2018deprescribing\u2019 of medications and lipid profiles. We were interested to investigate if these results would be replicated in a larger study based in \u2018real world\u2019 GP practice. 154 patients with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance were recruited into an observational cohort study in primary care. The effects of a low carbohydrate diet sustained for an average of two years (interquartile range 10\u201332 months) on cardiovascular risk factors were examined. Results demonstrate significant and substantial reductions in blood pressure (mean reduction of systolic BP 10.9 mmHg (interquartile range 0\u201322 mmHg) ( p  < 0.0001), mean reduction in diastolic BP 6.3 mmHg (interquartile range 0\u201312.8 mmHg) ( p  < 0.0001) and mean weight reduction of 9.5 Kg (interquartile range 5\u201313 Kg) ( p  < 0.0001) together with marked improvement in lipid profiles. This occurred despite a 20% reduction in anti-hypertensive medications. This novel and potentially highly effective dietary modification, done very cheaply alongside routine care, offers hope that should be tested in a large prospective trial.",

    "document": "The effect of a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet versus a low-glycemic index diet on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus\nObjective \n             Dietary carbohydrate is the major determinant of postprandial glucose levels, and several clinical studies have shown that low-carbohydrate diets improve glycemic control. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a diet lower in carbohydrate would lead to greater improvement in glycemic control over a 24-week period in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. \n           \n           \n             Research design and methods \n             Eighty-four community volunteers with obesity and type 2 diabetes were randomized to either a low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (<20 g of carbohydrate daily; LCKD) or a low-glycemic, reduced-calorie diet (500 kcal/day deficit from weight maintenance diet; LGID). Both groups received group meetings, nutritional supplementation, and an exercise recommendation. The main outcome was glycemic control, measured by hemoglobin A 1c . \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Forty-nine (58.3%) participants completed the study. Both interventions led to improvements in hemoglobin A 1c , fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and weight loss. The LCKD group had greater improvements in hemoglobin A 1c  (-1.5% vs. -0.5%, p = 0.03), body weight (-11.1 kg vs. -6.9 kg, p = 0.008), and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (+5.6 mg/dL vs. 0 mg/dL, p < 0.001) compared to the LGID group. Diabetes medications were reduced or eliminated in 95.2% of LCKD vs. 62% of LGID participants (p < 0.01). \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Dietary modification led to improvements in glycemic control and medication reduction/elimination in motivated volunteers with type 2 diabetes. The diet lower in carbohydrate led to greater improvements in glycemic control, and more frequent medication reduction/elimination than the low glycemic index diet.

The present study systematically reviews the currently available literature on the treatment of AKN. While all modalities are discussed, light and laser therapy is emphasized due to its relatively unknown role in clinical management of AKN. The most studied modalities in the literature were the 1064-nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser, 810-nm diode laser, and CO 2  laser, which allow for 82\u201395% improvement in 1\u20135 sessions.

Coagulopathy has been reported as associated with mortality in people with COVID-19 and is partially reflected by enhanced D-dimer levels. Poor vascular health, which is associated with the cardiometabolic health conditions frequently reported in people with severer forms of COVID-19, might exacerbate the risk of coagulopathy and mortality. Sedentary lifestyles might also contribute to the development of coagulopathy, and physical activity participation has been inherently lowered due to at-home regulations established to slow the spread of this highly infectious disease. It is possible that COVID-19, coagulation, and reduced physical activity may contribute to generate a \u201cperfect storm,\u201d where each fuels the other and potentially increases mortality risk. Several pharmaceutical agents are being explored to treat COVID-19, but potential negative consequences are associated with their use. Exercise is known to mitigate many of the identified side effects from the pharmaceutical agents being trialled but has not yet been considered as part of management for COVID-19. From the limited available evidence in people with cardiometabolic health conditions, low- to moderate-intensity exercise might have the potential to positively influence biochemical markers of coagulopathy, whereas high-intensity exercise is likely to increase thrombotic risk. Therefore, low- to moderate-intensity exercise could be an adjuvant therapy for people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and reduce the risk of developing severe symptoms of illness that are associated with enhanced mortality.",

Participants were 387,109 men and women (56.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8\u00a0yr; 55.1% women) residing in England from UK Biobank study. Physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, were assessed by questionnaire at baseline (2006 \u2013 2010). Body mass index, from measured height and weight, was used as an indicator of overall obesity. Outcome was cases of COVID-19 serious enough to warrant a hospital admission from 16-March-2020 to 26-April-2020. There were 760 COVID-19 cases. After adjustment for age, sex and mutually for each lifestyle factor, physical inactivity (Relative risk, 1.32, 95% confidence interval, 1.10, 1.58), smoking (1.42;1.12, 1.79) and obesity (2.05 ;1.68, 2.49) but not heavy alcohol consumption (1.12; 0.93, 1.35) were all related to COVID-19. We also found a dose-dependent increase in risk of COVID-19 with less favourable lifestyle scores, such that participants in the most adverse category had 4-fold higher risk (4.41; 2.52\u20137.71) compared to people with the most optimal lifestyle. C-reactive protein levels were associated with elevated risk of COVID-19 in a dose-dependent manner, and partly (10\u201316%) explained associations between adverse lifestyle and COVID-19. Based on UK risk factor prevalence estimates, unhealthy behaviours in combination accounted for up to 51% of the population attributable fraction of severe COVID-19. Our findings suggest that an unhealthy lifestyle synonymous with an elevated risk of non-communicable disease is also a risk factor for COVID-19 hospital admission, which might be partly explained by low grade inflammation. Adopting simple lifestyle changes could lower the risk of severe infection.",

    "document": "Potential harmful health effects of inhaling nicotine-free shisha-pen vapor: a chemical risk assessment of the main components propylene glycol and glycerol\nBackground \n             A shisha-pen is an electronic cigarette variant that is advertised to mimic the taste of a water pipe, or shisha. The aim of this study was to assess the potential harmful health effects caused by inhaling the vapor of a nicotine-free shisha-pen. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Gas chromatography analysis was performed to determine the major components in shisha-pen vapor. Risk assessment was performed using puff volumes of e-cigarettes and \u201cnormal\u201d cigarettes and a 1-puff scenario (one-time exposure). The concentrations that reached the airways and lungs after using a shisha-pen were calculated and compared to data from published toxicity studies. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The main components in shisha-pen vapor are propylene glycol and glycerol (54%/46%). One puff (50 to 70\u00a0mL) results in exposure of propylene glycol and glycerol of 430 to 603\u00a0mg/m 3  and 348 to 495\u00a0mg/m 3 , respectively. These exposure concentrations were higher than the points of departure for airway irritation based on a human study (propylene glycol, mean concentration of 309\u00a0mg/m 3 ) and a rat study (glycerol, no-observed adverse effect level of 165\u00a0mg/m 3 ). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Already after one puff of the shisha-pen, the concentrations of propylene glycol and glycerol are sufficiently high to potentially cause irritation of the airways. New products such as the shisha-pen should be detected and risks should be assessed to inform regulatory actions aimed at limiting potential harm that may be caused to consumers and protecting young people to take up smoking.",
    "response": "Relative to smoking and all of the included carcinogens, it's much \"safer\"\n\nThe problem with vaping or any other related product is that you're still inhaling (whether into your lungs or not) a thick smoke that produces turbulence and potential abrasion as it passes through the airway. Over time, the constant repair of this damage (again, way less than smoking) can theoretically lead to cancers.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that vaping is very new, and we know very little about the long-term health associations. All of the ingredients used are considered \"safe,\" but we really don't know how safe they are when they're heated up in high concentrations and slammed around in your airway.\n\nSmoking is far and away **much worse**, but that doesn't mean vaping is perfectly safe."

However, a study summarizing the findings of these reviews has not been conducted. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             This overview of systematic reviews aimed to summarize findings regarding the use of telemedicine across the 53 member states and identify the medical fields and levels of care in and at which the effectiveness, feasibility, and applicability of telemedicine have been demonstrated. The barriers to and facilitators of telemedicine use were also evaluated and collated to help with the design and implementation of telemedicine interventions. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Through a comprehensive systematic evaluation of the published and unpublished literature, we extracted clinical, epidemiological, and technology-related data from each review included in the study. We focused on evaluating the barriers to and facilitators of the use of telemedicine apps across the 53 member states considered. We rated the methodological quality of each of the included reviews based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review 2 approach and judged the overall certainty of evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations methodology. The entire process was performed by 2 independent authors. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             This overview drew on data from >2239 primary studies, with >20,000 enrolled patients in total, within the WHO European Region. On the basis of data from randomized trials, observational studies, and economic evaluations from several countries, the results show a clear benefit of telemedicine technologies in the screening, diagnosis, management, treatment, and long-term follow-up of a series of chronic diseases. However, we were unable to pool the results into a reliable numeric parameter because of the high heterogeneity of intervention methodologies, scheduling, primary study design discrepancies, settings, and geographical locations. In addition to the clinical outcomes of the interventions, the social and economic outcomes are highlighted. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The application of telemedicine is well established across countries in the WHO European Region; however, some countries could still benefit from the many uses of these digital solutions. Barriers related to users, technology, and infrastructure were the largest. Conversely, the provision of health services using technological devices was found to significantly enhance patients\u2019 clinical outcomes, improve the long-term follow-up of patients by medical professionals, and offer logistical benefits for both patients and health workers. \n           \n           \n             Trial Registration \n             PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews) CRD42022309375; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=309375",

The practice of yoga postures is associated with increased brain GABA levels. This study addresses the question of whether changes in mood, anxiety, and GABA levels are specific to yoga or related to physical activity. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Healthy subjects with no significant medical/psychiatric disorders were randomized to yoga or a metabolically matched walking intervention for 60 minutes 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Mood and anxiety scales were taken at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and before each magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan. Scan 1 was at baseline. Scan 2, obtained after the 12-week intervention, was followed by a 60-minute yoga or walking intervention, which was immediately followed by Scan 3. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The yoga subjects ( n \u2009=\u200919) reported greater improvement in mood and greater decreases in anxiety than the walking group ( n \u2009=\u200915). There were positive correlations between improved mood and decreased anxiety and thalamic GABA levels. The yoga group had positive correlations between changes in mood scales and changes in GABA levels. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             The 12-week yoga intervention was associated with greater improvements in mood and anxiety than a metabolically matched walking exercise. This is the first study to demonstrate that increased thalamic GABA levels are associated with improved mood and decreased anxiety. It is also the first time that a behavioral intervention (i.e., yoga postures) has been associated with a positive correlation between acute increases in thalamic GABA levels and improvements in mood and anxiety scales. Given that pharmacologic agents that increase the activity of the GABA system are prescribed to improve mood and decrease anxiety, the reported correlations are in the expected direction. The possible role of GABA in mediating the beneficial effects of yoga on mood and anxiety warrants further study.",

COVID-19 features a state of hyperinflammation resulting in a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d, which leads to severe complications, such as the development of micro-thrombosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Despite isolation measures, the number of affected patients is growing daily: as of June 12th, over 7.5 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 420,000 global deaths. Over 3.5 million patients have recovered from COVID-19; although this number is increasing by the day, great attention should be directed towards the possible long-term outcomes of the disease.

    "document": "From the Tattoo Studio to the Emergency Room\nBackground \n             While subepidermal skin inking as a fashion trend has rapidly gained popularity in Western societies, systemic anaphylaxis as a complication of tattooing has only been described once in refereed literature. Furthermore the previously reported case was from a patient who already suffered from severe allergies and no attempt to pinpoint the actual causes was made. \n           \n           \n             Case Summary \n             We present the case of a 59-year-old man, who developed a progressive swelling and redness five hours after receiving a tattoo. Another hour later he appeared in the emergency room with a grade 3 systemic anaphylaxis. He presented with rapidly progressing swelling and redness of the tattooed left arm, left cheek and lips as well as tongue. Allergies were not previously known in this patient. He responded well to treatment with prednisolone and antihistamines. Further workup identified formaldehyde, nickel, and manganese in the inks as potential chemical triggers of the patient\u2019s symptoms. The patient refused further allergological work-up, such as prick testing. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Clinicians should be alert to the potential capacity of tattoo inks to act as triggers of systemic anaphylaxis. Policymakers should attempt to better restrict the use of known allergenic compounds in commercial tattoo inks. \n             Subepidermal skin inking as a fashion trend has rapidly has rapidly spread throughout Western societies in the 21 st  century ( 1 ). Some 120 million people in North America and Europe are tattooed ( 2 ,  3 ). Nevertheless, tattoo-related health risks are insufficiently characterized and health effects of inks applied have never been tested in animals or humans ( 1 ). Among the current list of tattoo-related acute health effects are infections and local inflammatory and allergic reactions ( 1 ). Nevertheless, professional tattoos are generally considered safe, presumably because there is a dearth of reports on life-threatening cases as the one described below. \n           \n           \n             Patient Information \n             At 3 pm, a subjectively healthy 59-year old German man living in the Berlin-Brandenburg area had his left forearm tattooed to cover up a tattoo he had obtained in his early twenties (size of the freshly applied black and white tattoo: = 7 x 12 cm 2 ) .  Five hours later, he noticed progressive swelling and redness around the tattooed area which had progressed to grade 3 systemic anaphylaxis when he was brought to our emergency department an hour later. His chief complaints included rapidly increasing swelling, redness of the left arm, left cheeks, lips and tongue. This led to progressive dyspnoea, and burning sensations in the affected areas and retrosternally. He denied similar episodes and known allergies. The patient reportedly did not consume any unusual foods or medicines. His medical history was positive for \n             \n               \n                 hypertension, \n               \n               \n                 diabetes mellitus type II, \n               \n               \n                 gout, \n               \n               \n                 and former smoking. \n               \n             \n             His current medication contained bisoprolol 5 mg p.o. qd, telmisartan 80/25 mg p.o. qd, metformin 1 g p.o. bid and allopurinol 500 mg p.o., qd. \n           \n           \n             Physical Exam \n             The mildly obese patient presented with a normal sinus rhythm (70 bpm), hypertension (195/116 mmHg), and tachypnoea (26 bpm). His airways were threatened by tongue swelling. We heard decreased respiratory sounds with a prolonged expiratory phase. Pulse oximetry showed a 99% blood oxygen saturation, the body temperature was 36.9\u00b0C. He was alert, oriented, cooperative and showed no signs of focal neurological deficits. Left arm, shoulder, cheek, lips and tongue appeared swollen, red, and hot. Sclera and conjunctiva were normal. \n           \n           \n             Diagnostic Findings \n             Blood values were normal bar mildly elevated C-reactive protein (8 mg/l, reference <5 mg/l) and alanine aminotransferase (63 U/l, reference <50 U/l) levels. \n           \n           \n             Interventions \n             Because of the potentially life-threatening condition, the patient was given intravenous clemastine hydrogen fumarate (2 mg), an H1-receptor antagonist, and prednisolone 21-sodium succinate (1 g), which resulted in rapid clinical improvement. However, we admitted him to our hospital for further observation because of the possibility of a bi-phasic or prolonged allergic reaction and decided to discharge him in only after two days because difficulties swallowing persisted for 36 hours. We assume that the offending agent must have been carried to excretion through the lymphatic system, which explains the full recovery not before the medication effects waned. \n           \n           \n             Follow-Up and Outcomes \n             The patient was informed that further allergological work-up (e.g. prick-testing) was indicated to help avoid further exposure to harmful compounds. Yet he did not consider this a priority since he decided to never have another tattoo performed again. Moreover, he did not expect to change his lifestyle and nutritional habits, which thus far proved safe for him. He did agree, however, to present to our outpatient department for a follow-up evaluation of his C1q complement which was found to be mildly elevated (209 mg/l, reference range: 124\u2013190 mg/l) and C4, which was normal, making a C1 inhibitor deficiency or dysfunction unlikely as a cause for the anaphylaxis. \n           \n           \n             Analytical Assessment \n             Ink analyses: After the allergic symptoms resolved, our patient sought information from his tattooist on the inks applied. In the following, two samples of each of those inks obtained from the original supplier were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV), and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) according to their contents on altogether 28 different substances, comprising elements, formaldehyde and other preservatives, such as parabens and isothiazolinones, respectively. To this end we used validated protocols that can be provided upon request. The most important analytical results of the inks obtained in the first purchase are compiled in  Table 1 . The black ink revealed a content of 63 mg total and 11 mg free formaldehyde/kg. We also detected nickel and manganese at concentrations of 5.2 and 60 mg/kg, respectively. The formaldehyde levels measured in the same kind of black ink from the second purchase were 106 (total) and 67 (free) mg/kg ink. \n           \n           \n             Literature Review \n             Our literature search (PubMed Central, Ovid and Web of Science) identified articles published up to September 20, 2015 using the keywords \u201eanaphylaxis\u201c and \u201esystemic allergic reaction\u201c in combination with the keywords \u201etattoo\u201c, \u201esubepidermal ink\u201c, \u201esubepidermal inking\u201c (24, 2, and 15, respectively) in title, abstract and body. Articles that did not address the issue of anaphylaxis and its relationship with subepidermal tattooing were omitted, leaving 2 relevant papers. \n           \n           \n             Discussion \n             Strengths and limitations: This report adds to the scarce body of literature concerning systemic allergic reactions to subepidermal skin inking. Only one report ( 4 ) describes a case of anaphylaxis in a 30-year-old atopic woman (previously diagnosed with seasonal allergic rhinitis, asthma, eczema, and animal allergies to dogs, cats, and horses) after receiving her third and fourth tattoo in 1999. She underwent an allergy prick skin testing. It was positive for 2 out of 13 different ink colors made by 2 different manufacturers. The patient did not develop systemic anaphylaxis though. Unfortunately, the authors did not mention the time lag between the prick testing (whose findings were published in 2009) and the allergic reaction (1999) and it is further unclear whether the tested inks were similar to those applied a decade earlier. Also, hereditary angioedema as a possible cause had not been ruled out. In another paper, Teixeira et al. present the case ( 5 ) of an atopic female, who developed allergic reactions (but no anaphylaxis), after having her eyelashes tinted with a permanent black dye that contained  para -phenylenediamine, which has been reported to cause acute hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis when used in hair-dye ( 6 ). \n             On the other hand, our approach also has limitations. \n             \n               \n                 We unfortunately did not receive the opportunity to perform a prick-test to confirm an allergy in our patient. \n               \n               \n                 We abstained from collecting a biopsy from the tattooed tissue for further evaluation because we did not see a justification for harming the patient with invasive diagnostics. Nevertheless, we believe that our extensive analytical assessments provide enough evidence to suggest that several compounds are being used or being present as contaminants in commercial tattoo inks even though they are common and strong allergens. \n               \n               \n                 It is a fact that tattoo inks comprise a diverse range of chemicals present as ingredients or impurities, well more than the selected 28 substances we evaluated. For many of them, not only validated analytical methods are still missing, but also any appropriate toxicological risk assessment for the exposure route of intradermal deposition ( 1 ). Due to these uncertainties, a contribution of other compounds to the observed symptoms cannot completely be ruled out. However, given the known and strong allergenicity of formaldehyde and of the additional two elements indicted (i.e., nickel and manganese), their central role in the dramatic anaphylaxis reaction described seems beyond all question. \n               \n             \n             \n               Implications \n               In 2003 and 2008, two resolutions were published by the Council of Europe regarding the safety of tattoo products. Although not legally binding to European member states, the more recent bill [i.e., ResAP(2008)1] suggests that preservatives may be used to ensure preservation of the products after opening. Since formaldehyde is commonly used in cosmetic products and\u2014moreover\u2014tattoo inks are usually but falsely perceived being nothing else than cosmetics, it is not surprising that this compound occasionally can be also detected in tattoo inks ( 1 ). \n               While formaldehyde is unable to penetrate through an intact epidermal barrier made of cornified keratinocytes (ie,  Stratum corneum ), direct injection into living and vascularized dermal tissue may result in immediate systemic bioavailability. Besides rhinitis, asthma and contact dermatitis ( 7 ), anaphylactic reactions due to formaldehyde have been described in the case mentioned above ( 4 ), and after hemodialysis or endodontic treatment ( 8 ,  9 ). For nickel and manganese, no such association to anaphylaxis has been reported yet. Both elements are strong contact allergens though ( 10 ). Thus, a combined effect of the preservative and metal impurities becomes highly likely. \n               This assumption is further supported by the analytical results obtained in our study. Out of the 28 substances selected for analysis based on regular complaints in the frame of market surveys ( 11 \u2013  13 ), no other culprits that might have been responsible for the induction of anaphylaxis could be detected at considerable levels. In particular, conspicuous preservatives such as bronopol, various parabens, sodium benzoate, 2-phenoxyethanol or the commonly used isothiazolinones, eg. 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one and 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, did not exceed their individual detection thresholds. In general, the risks associated with allergens in tattoo ink should be considered not just by clinicians but also by policy-makers and stakeholders within the tattoo-industry. \n             \n           \n           \n             Conclusion and Rationale \n             The present case highlights the need for an increased awareness of risks associated with the dermal injection of inks. It also calls for a tighter regulation of products used in tattooing, increasing public and industry awareness, and the development of analytical means to get more knowledge on its constituents. Recognizing tattooing as a unique scenario that overcomes the skin barrier, it seems obvious that current measures are insufficient to protect consumer health ( 1 ). \n             \n               Ethical Considerations \n               Written informed consent was obtained from the patient described in the case report. No ethics committee approval was necessary. The article was written in adherence to the CARE guidelines ( 14 ) for clinical case reporting. \n               \n                 Conflict of interest statement \n               \n               All authors declare that no conflict of interest exists. \n               \n                 Funding/Support \n               \n               No external funding was obtained.",

We conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials that evaluated acyclovir for the treatment of chickenpox in otherwise healthy children. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched. The reference lists of relevant articles were examined and primary authors and Glaxo Wellcome were contacted to identify additional trials. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed study quality using the Jadad scale and allocation concealment, and extracted data. Continuous data were converted to a weighted mean difference (WMD). Overall estimates were not calculated due to differences in the age groups studied. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Three studies were included.

Acyclovir was associated with a significant reduction in the number of days with fever, from -1.0 (95% CI -1.5,-0.5) to -1.3 (95% CI -2.0,-0.6). Results were inconsistent with respect to the number of days to no new lesions, the maximum number of lesions and relief of pruritis. There were no clinically important differences between acyclovir and placebo with respect to complications or adverse effects. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Acyclovir appears to be effective in reducing the number of days with fever among otherwise healthy children with chickenpox. The results were inconsistent with respect to the number of days to no new lesions, the maximum number of lesions and the relief of itchiness.

    "document": "Signaling mechanisms in mirror image pain pathogenesis\nIt is now clear that a peripheral nerve lesion affects contralateral non-lesioned structures, and thus such a lesion can result in mirror image pain. The pathogenesis is still not exactly known, but there are some possible signaling pathways in the contralateral reaction of the nerve tissue after unilateral nerve injury. Potential signaling pathways of contralateral changes can be generally divided into humoral and neuronal mechanisms. Damage to peripheral nerves or spinal roots produces a number of breakdown products with development of an aseptic inflammatory reaction. Released immunomodulatory cytokines are believed to be transported via blood or cerebrospinal fluid into the contralateral part of the body affecting spinal roots, dorsal root ganglia or peripheral nerves. Because neurons are elements of a highly organized network, injury to the peripheral neuron results in signals that travel transneuronally into the central nervous system and affects the contralateral homonymous neurons. There is also evidence that spinal glia creates and maintain pathological pain. Additionally, there may be compensatory changes in behavior of animals with an impact on contralateral neurons, such as altered stance and motor performance or autonomic reflex changes. Although the transneuronal signaling pathway appears to be plausible, the humoral signaling pathway or other communication systems cannot be excluded at this time. Knowledge about these processes has clinical implications for the understanding of chronic neuropathic pain states, and, therefore, further studies will be necessary. Understanding signaling mechanisms in mirror image pain pathogenesis may provide novel therapeutic targets for the management of neuropathic pain.",

Bowtie/Tophat were used to align 50-bp paired-end reads into transcripts, Cufflinks to measure the relative abundance of each transcript and IPA to analyze RNA-Sequencing data. In the 100\u2009mg/l NaF-treated group, four pathways related to IL-17, TGF-\u03b2 and other cellular growth factor pathways were overexpressed. The mRNA expression of  IL-17RA ,  IL-17RC ,  MAP2K1 ,  MAP2K2 ,  MAP2K3  and  MAPKAPK2 , monitored by qRT-PCR, increased remarkably in the 100\u2009mg/L NaF group and coincided with the result of RNA-Sequencing. Fluoride exposure could disrupt spermatogenesis and testicles in male mice by influencing many signaling pathways and genes, which work on the immune signal transduction and cellular metabolism. The high expression of the IL-17 signal pathway was a response to the invasion of the testicular immune system due to extracellular fluoride. The PI3-kinase/AKT, MAPKs and the cytokines in TGF-\u03b2 family were contributed to control the IL-17 pathway activation and maintain the immune privilege and spermatogenesis.

    "question": "EDIT: Just want to say THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who has commented on this post with tips and knowledge. I appreciate the support so much because after going to many doctors it was starting to feel like I was on my own here. Thank you thank you thank you!\n\nPosting here because at this point I\u2019ll literally try anything for help. \nBefore I get into the details, I will say I have been prone to yeast infections since I was about 15yo but never had a bacterial infection. \nBack in July 2019 I had what I thought was a yeast infection and I was putting off going to get the medicine because it wasnt THAT irritating at this point. One morning I woke up and had horrible irritation and pain down there and was running about a 101 degree fever. My mom took me to a friend of hers who is a doctor because I was able to get in right away. They swabbed me and prescribed me Clyndomiazin (spelling is off I\u2019m sure) I finished it and was all back to normal in a week or so, but then in mid August the symptoms were back. It was a Saturday so I went to urgent care and told them everything that had happened and they gave me a shot of clyndomiazin and prescribed me antibiotics by mouth. I finished those and was still feeling discomfort so I booked with an OBGYN and he swabbed me and looked at the cells under a microscope and told me I didn\u2019t have enough good bacteria from taking all the medicine and that\u2019s why I still had irritation because I had essentially burned all the protective layers of my vaginal walls off and everything was exposed nerve endings. He prescribed me a steroid to insert every night for 5 nights, after that I felt fine! \nThen in October 2019 I started dating my current boyfriend. We had sex and the next day I was showing signs of a yeast/bacterial infection, I went to the doctor and the swabbed me and yep had one so I was prescribed flagul orally. Then had sex again with my boyfriend and it happened again, so I brought it up to him because now I was worried about STDs. We were both tested, we\u2019re both clean. But the doctor explained to me that it is possible our individual flora don\u2019t match up well and that\u2019s why I am getting these infections. So him and I abstain from sex for a good few months because I keep getting these reoccurring infections and absolutely no relief. Seeing doctor after doctor because no one really is listening to be or taking it seriously. I finally seem to get it under control in late December early January. THEN in February I am having symptoms again, but have not had sex with my boyfriend so I know it\u2019s not just being caused by him at this point. I book an appointment with a doctor who is a woman because at this point I was only able to get in with male OBGYN at the clinic I was going to and was not feeling heard. So I go see my doctor and she listens to everything I say, swabs me and sees that my cervix is inflamed so she asked if I\u2019ve been tested for HPV, I wasn\u2019t sure because that wasn\u2019t on the paper when I was STD tested back in like November. She performed a pap too. \nSwab comes back positive for bacteria, pap is normal. She prescribes me flagul orally. I take it, things go back to normal. I finally feel safe enough to have sex with my boyfriend again. We did, everything was fine for like 2 weeks and I\u2019m STOKED. Then I wake up one morning with that irritation and at this point I know what\u2019s going on because I\u2019ve been dealing with this since July 2019. \nI get in with my doctor. She swabs just to be safe but prescribes me flagul vaginal inserts which I had not done. She said instead of doing it 5 nights in a row, do it twice a week for a month. Also, swab came back positive for bacteria.\nI\u2019ve now finished my 3rd week of inserts and am waiting to do my fourth after my cycle is over. Around week 2 of inserts I noticed white chunks of discharge coming out, slight odor but only if I got close to it. It wasn\u2019t like I could smell it just laying down or anything. I had never had this type of discharge since this all started happening. And I know it\u2019s not the medicine coming out because that is a clear gel and this has the consistency of a small cheese curd (gross I know but best comparison). The irritation has not stopped and sometimes feels even worse. I have an appointment to see her this coming Wednesday, but I just thought I\u2019d come here to see if anyone out there has ever seen this before. It is really starting to affect my mental health and everyday life because I\u2019m constantly feeling dirty and uncomfortable, plus it is affecting my sex life. My boyfriend is understanding and supportive but it\u2019s rough for me especially since this is a new relationship. \nI occasionally drink but have almost come to a complete stop because I know that promotes the bad bacteria, I do not smoke cigarettes and have been clean from weed for 40 days (trying to find a new job).\nI have started taking probiotic pills over the last 2 months, I try my best to eat a yogurt every morning and I have at least 1 kombucha a day since the beginning of the year. All to promote the good bacteria. \nI am prescribed 20 mg of Vibryd an SSRI, 60 mg of Dexilant and I take birth control, same one since I was 16 years old. \nI have not changed any laundry soaps, I use Cetaphil to clean that area, only wear cotton undies and don\u2019t wear any at night when I sleep, do not use douching methods or any vaginal cleansing wipes. I occasionally use baby wipes but they have no scent and the ingredients are safe. \nIf anyone out there has anything helpful, I\u2019d love to hear it. Thanks everyone!",
    "document": "Vaginal yeast infections during pregnancy\nABSTRACT \n           QUESTION  My pregnant patients often present with symptomatic vaginal yeast infections. Are the medications commonly used for the management of yeast infections safe to use during pregnancy? \n           ANSWER  Existing data indicate that exposure to oral and topical antifungals, topical antiseptics, or corticosteroids during pregnancy is not associated with increased risk of major malformations. Topical azole antifungals are the recommended treatment during pregnancy for at least 7 days owing to increased efficacy. Topical corticosteroids can be used for symptomatic relief.",
    "response": "Firstly, recurrent BV sucks so I'm sorry you're going through it. Brace yourself, I'm about to give my 'recurrent BV' talk! Usually it's a shotgun approach where I recommend people try all of these things to find out what helps.\n\n1) Metrogel 0.75% 5g intravaginally daily for 5 days as needed (skip this if you don't actually have BV right now)\n\n2) Consider condom use or abstinence - semen has a high pH which helps BV happen\n\n3) Consider oral birth control plll as this reduces risk - if you notice any relation to periods do continuous pills (meaning skip placebo week and never have a period. you don't need one)\n\n4) Little evidence for probiotics but go for it\n\n5) Hygiene - showering, no douching/vaginal soap. No loofas. If a wipe is needed, use clean face towels once (relaunder before using again) and wash vulva first before any other part of your body.\n\n6) No underwear at night when possible\n\n7) Male hygiene - Make him wash off that junk first\n\n8) Boric acid - vaginal suppositories. (Note: don't eat it, it'll kill you but 100% safe vaginally). This will make it impossible for BV or frankly yeast to grow. This can be irritating however. For some women I'll recommend they take it daily for a week and then do 2-3 times per week thereafter.  Another good option is if you have a compounding pharmacy you can request they make boric acid and lactobacillus combo suppositories. This will give you the good pH from the boric acid but also the right healthy bacteria.\n\nGood luck, may your bottom return to its happiest days. Let me know if this works for you!"

    "question": "Long post about Covid Vaccine.  Feel free to answer any or all questions, if you care to.  I APPRECIATE IT! \n\nME: (42F/5'4\", 225 LBS, caucasian, Juvenile (type 1) diabetes, 8.3 hemoglobin a1c, drink 3x's per week, no drugs)\n\nHello, Doctors, and thank you for your participation on this board.  I appreciate your care, your time, and your effort.\n\nSO.  Some of you doctors may have heard of something called Covid-19  (wink, giggle!)   I'm trying to decide whether or not to get the vaccine, and I'm taking care to seek knowledge via reputable sources only.     I'm somewhat overwhelmed and upset, and I'm wondering if anyone would be kind enough to weigh in.  Here are the details:\n\n1-I'm definitely NOT an anti-vaxxer. \n\n2-I'm ignoring anecdotes and favoring doctors/scientists' expertise.  I'm not asking medical advice of angry YouTubers.  I'm here asking doctors and scientists.  :)\n\n3-I've been socially distancing, masking, and/or quarantining.  I know Covid is real, and I don't think it's a ploy for the government to kill us (or enter your favorite conspiracy theory here, if you care to?)  Pandemic?  Yes. \n\n4-I care about my health, and I also care about the health of my community and world at large.\n\n5-My general attitude towards doctors is a positive one: in general, I think doctors have scientific training, and they care about their patients.  I don't believe that my doctor has a nefarious plan to trick me into getting a vaccine so she can buy a luxury yacht.   \n\n6-(Here's where things get sticky.  Please hear me out, because it's the major crux of my decision!)  I LOATHE pharmaceutical companies.  I hope their executives burn to death in a fire. Price gouging on insulin is awful, and it has negatively affected my (and other diabetics' lives) in serious and large ways.  I HATE THEM.  I don't trust them, and yet I'm dependent on their product to live.   \n\nHere's why I'm mentioning this: I know some pharmaceuticals (most, I suppose) are wonderful, and that they help us be healthier--whether I personally loathe them or not.    But I also see how pharma companies have lied and destroyed lives in order to make money.  (See: Johnson and Johnson talc powder, opioids, etc).  I also see that they're willing to price gouge on insulin, epi-pens, etc.  They've proven that they're capable of and willing to lie and hurt people if it helps their bottom line. So then....I'm hesitant to believe, without question, that their vaccines are as safe as they claim to be. \n\nI don't \\*necesssarily\\* think the vaccines are harmful, but I am concerned.  It seems that even doctors and science cannot reasonably guarantee the vaccines will not cause problems in the future.   With the understanding that NOTHING in life is fully free of risk, I still do wonder/worry how to perform an accurate risk-to-benefit analysis.\n\n7-Do you doctors worry that YOU'RE not working with accurate data?    Some say the CDC etc have manipulated data, and that doctors themselves may be, in turn, inadvertently giving their patients bad advice.   How much of the vaccine advice you're giving is SPECIFIC to Covid....versus how much is well-established, scientifically sound advice?    And do you worry that there may be effective studies that simply haven't been funded?   \n\nThere are some peer-reviewed studies on whether ivermectin and hydrochloroquine can at least HELP with the treatment/prevention of Covid.  What if these things are wise to use (even in conjunction/as a complement to vaccine?), but they're not being studied well?   I'm wondering how much of these vaccine studies are simply heavily funded by pharmaceutical companies, and as a layman who cares about her health, and about knowledge and truth, I'm honestly  not always sure where to get fact-based, solid info.  (Lots of tin-foil hat info to wade through!)     :)\n\n8-Should patients be getting antibody testing to see if the vaccine may be unnecessary? \n\n9-'Get the vaccine' seems to be a blanket suggestion for nearly everyone. Is this because more individualized advice would simply be impossible when looking at the entire world, during a pandemic?   If so, that's understandable, but does it make sense for individuals to try to 'customize' their own health choices a bit more?   For example, I'm only working online and gathering with people outside--with a rare inside visit, sitting six feet apart.  Is it possible that this is a sufficient amount of choices for me, and that I can avoid the vaccine? \n\n10-We had a large family trip planned, and we postponed it due to Covid.  Before the Delta variant was on the radar, it looked like things were getting better, so we booked the trip, as it seemed to be a safe and responsible decision.   (It will involve a five hour plane ride from the East Coast to Utah and Idaho.  Our activities will largely be outside, but we'll be sharing an Airbnb and car.  Only one person in my family is vaccinated.)  My doctor told me to double-mask on the plane, but I'm worried about taking this trip unvaccinated. If I don't choose to get vaccinated, is this irresponsible to do, especially in light of the Delta variant?   Is wearing a mask inside the whole time perhaps sufficient? \n\nSIGH.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I'm really not sure what to do, and I'm trying to find an answer that is both personally and societally responsible.  Please feel free to share your absolutely honest feedback---no need to hold back.  \n\nAgain, I greatly appreciate members of this Subreddit sharing their time and knowledge.",
    "document": "Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID\u201019\nAbstract \n           \n             Background \n             Ivermectin, an antiparasitic agent used to treat parasitic infestations, inhibits the replication of viruses in vitro. The molecular hypothesis of ivermectin's antiviral mode of action suggests an inhibitory effect on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) replication in the early stages of infection.\u00a0Currently, evidence on efficacy and safety of ivermectin for prevention of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection and COVID\u201019 treatment is conflicting. \n           \n           \n             Objectives \n             To assess the efficacy and safety of ivermectin compared to no treatment, standard of care, placebo, or any other proven intervention for people with COVID\u201019 receiving treatment as inpatients or outpatients, and for prevention of an infection with SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (postexposure prophylaxis). \n           \n           \n             Search methods \n             We searched the Cochrane COVID\u201019 Study Register, Web of Science (Emerging Citation Index and Science Citation Index), medRxiv, and Research Square, identifying completed and ongoing studies without language restrictions to 26 May 2021. \n           \n           \n             Selection criteria \n             We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ivermectin to no treatment, standard of care, placebo, or another proven intervention for treatment of people with confirmed COVID\u201019 diagnosis, irrespective of disease severity, treated in inpatient or outpatient settings, and for prevention of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. \n             Co\u2010interventions had to be the same in both study arms.\u00a0 \n             We excluded studies comparing ivermectin to other pharmacological interventions with unproven efficacy. \n           \n           \n             Data collection and analysis \n             We assessed RCTs for bias, using the Cochrane risk of bias 2 tool. The primary analysis excluded studies with high risk of bias. We used GRADE to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes 1. to treat inpatients with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe COVID\u201019: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, adverse events,\u00a0quality of life, duration of hospitalization, and viral clearance; 2. to treat outpatients with mild COVID\u201019: mortality, clinical worsening or improvement, admission to hospital, adverse events,\u00a0quality of life, and viral clearance;\u00a0(3) to prevent SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection: SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, development of COVID\u201019 symptoms, adverse events,\u00a0mortality, admission to hospital, and quality of life. \n           \n           \n             Main results \n             We found 14 studies with 1678 participants investigating ivermectin compared to no treatment, placebo, or standard of care. No study compared ivermectin to an intervention with proven efficacy. There were nine studies treating participants with moderate COVID\u201019 in inpatient settings and four treating mild COVID\u201019 cases in outpatient settings. One study investigated ivermectin for prevention of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. Eight studies had an open\u2010label design, six were double\u2010blind and placebo\u2010controlled.\u00a0Of the 41 study results contributed by included studies, about one third were at overall high risk of bias.\u00a0 \n             Ivermectin doses and treatment duration varied among included studies.\u00a0 \n             We identified 31 ongoing and 18 studies awaiting classification until publication of results or clarification of inconsistencies. \n             \n               Ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care for inpatient COVID\u201019 treatment \n             \n             We are uncertain whether ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care reduces or increases mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 2.51; 2 studies, 185 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and clinical worsening up to day 28 assessed as need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.59; 2 studies, 185 participants;\u00a0very low\u2010certainty evidence) or need for supplemental oxygen (0 participants required supplemental oxygen; 1 study, 45 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), adverse events within 28 days (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.97; 1 study, 152 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence), and viral clearance at day seven (RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.51 to 6.48; 2 studies, 159 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care on clinical improvement up to 28 days (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.35; 1 study; 73 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and duration of hospitalization (mean difference (MD) \u22120.10 days, 95% CI \u22122.43 to 2.23; 1 study; 45 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life up to 28 days. \n             \n               Ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care for outpatient COVID\u201019 treatment \n             \n             We are uncertain whether ivermectin compared to placebo or standard of care reduces or increases mortality up to 28 days (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.05; 2 studies, 422 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) and clinical worsening up to 14 days assessed as need for IMV (RR 2.97, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.47; 1 study, 398 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence) or non\u2010IMV or high flow oxygen requirement (0 participants required non\u2010IMV or high flow; 1 study, 398 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ivermectin compared to placebo reduces or increases viral clearance at seven days (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 67.06; 1 study, 24 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). Ivermectin may have little or no effect compared to placebo or standard of care on the number of participants with symptoms resolved up to 14 days (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.21; 1 study, 398 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence) and adverse events within 28 days (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.05; 2 studies, 422 participants; low\u2010certainty evidence). None of the studies reporting duration of symptoms were eligible for primary analysis. No study reported hospital admission or quality of life up to 14 days. \n             \n               Ivermectin compared to no treatment for prevention of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection \n             \n             We found one study. Mortality up to 28 days was the only outcome eligible for primary analysis. We are uncertain whether ivermectin reduces or increases mortality compared to no treatment (0 participants died; 1 study,\u00a0304 participants; very low\u2010certainty evidence). The study reported results for development of COVID\u201019 symptoms and adverse events up to 14 days that were included in a secondary analysis due to high risk of bias. No study reported SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, hospital admission, and quality of life up to 14 days. \n           \n           \n             Authors' conclusions \n             Based on the current very low\u2010 to low\u2010certainty evidence, we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of ivermectin used to treat or prevent COVID\u201019. The completed studies are small and few are considered high quality. Several studies are underway that may produce clearer answers in review updates. Overall, the reliable evidence available does not support the use of ivermectin for treatment or prevention of COVID\u201019 outside of well\u2010designed randomized trials. \n           \n        \n           Plain language summary \n           \n             Ivermectin for preventing and treating COVID\u201019 \n           \n           \n             Is ivermectin effective for COVID\u201019? \n           \n           \n             Key messages \n           \n           We found no evidence to support the use of ivermectin for treating or preventing COVID\u201019 infection, but the evidence base is limited. \n           Evaluation of ivermectin is continuing in 31 ongoing studies, and we will update this review with their results when they become available.\u00a0 \n           \n             What is ivermectin? \n           \n           Ivermectin is a medicine used to treat parasites such as intestinal parasites in animals and scabies in humans.\u00a0It is cheap and is widely used in regions of the world where parasitic infestations are common. It has few unwanted effects.\u00a0 \n           Tests in the laboratory show ivermectin can slow the reproduction of the COVID\u201019 (SARS\u2010CoV\u20102) virus but such effects would need major doses in humans. Medical regulators have not approved ivermectin for COVID\u201019. It should only be used as part of well\u2010designed studies (called randomized controlled trials) evaluating potential effects.\u00a0 \n           \n             What did we want to find out? \n           \n           We wanted to know if ivermectin reduces death, illness, and length of infection in people with COVID\u201019, or is useful in prevention of the disease. We included studies comparing the medicine to placebo (dummy treatment), no treatment, usual care, or treatments for COVID\u201019 that are known to work to some extent, such as remdesivir or dexamethasone. We excluded studies that compared ivermectin to other drugs that do not work, such as hydroxychloroquine, or that are not known to be effective against COVID\u201019. \n           We evaluated the effects of ivermectin in infected people on: \n           \u2013 people dying;\u2028\u2013 whether people's COVID\u201019 symptoms got better or worse;\u00a0\u2028\u2013 unwanted effects;\u2028\u2013 hospital admission or time in hospital;\u00a0\u2028\u2013 viral clearance. \n           For prevention, we sought the effect on preventing COVID\u201019 and SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection. \n           \n             What did we do?\u00a0 \n           \n           We searched for randomized controlled trials that investigated ivermectin to prevent or treat COVID\u201019 in humans. People being treated with ivermectin had to have laboratory\u2010test confirmed COVID\u201019 and be receiving treatment in hospital or as outpatients. \n           We compared and summarized the results of the studies and rated our confidence in the evidence, based on common criteria as to how reliable the evidence is. \n           \n             What did we find?\u00a0 \n           \n           We found 14 studies with 1678 participants that investigated ivermectin compared to no treatment, placebo, or usual care. \n           For treatment, there were nine studies of people with moderate COVID\u201019 in hospital and four of outpatients with mild COVID\u201019. The studies used different doses of ivermectin and different durations of treatment. \n           One study investigated ivermectin to prevent COVID\u201019. \n           We also found 31 ongoing studies, and there are 18 studies still requiring clarification from the authors or not yet published. \n           Main results \u00a0 \n           \n             Treating people in hospital with COVID\u201019 \n           \n           We don't know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care, 28 days after treatment: \n           \u2013 leads to more or fewer deaths (2 studies, 185 people);\u00a0\u2028\u2013 worsens or improves patients' condition assessed by need for ventilation (2 studies, 185 people) or oxygen (1 study, 45 people);\u00a0\u2028\u2013 increases or reduces unwanted events (1 study, 152 people). \n           Seven days after treatment, we don't know if ivermectin: \n           \u2013 increases or reduces negative COVID\u201019 tests (2 studies, 159 people). \n           Ivermectin compared to placebo or usual care may make little or no difference to improving patients' condition 28 days after treatment (1 study, 73 people) or to length of hospital stay (1 study, 45 people). \n           \n             Treating outpatients with COVID\u201019 \n           \n           We don't know whether ivermectin compared with placebo or usual care: \n           \u2013 leads to more or fewer deaths 28 days after treatment (2 studies, 422 people);\u00a0\u2028\u2013 worsens or improves patients' condition 14 days after treatment assessed by need for ventilation (1 study, 398 people);\u00a0\u2028\u2013 increases or reduces negative COVID\u201019 tests seven days after treatment (1 study, 24 people). \n           Ivermectin compared to placebo or usual care may make little or no difference to improving outpatients' condition 14 days after treatment (1 study, 398 people) or to the number of unwanted events 28 days after treatment (2 studies, 422 people). \n           No studies looked at hospital admissions in outpatients. \n           \n             Preventing COVID\u201019 \n           \n           We don't know whether ivermectin leads to more or fewer deaths compared with no drug (1 study, 304 people); no participant died 28 days after the drug. This study reported results for development of COVID\u201019 symptoms (but not confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection) and unwanted events, but in a way that we could not include in our analyses. This study did not look at hospital admissions. \n           \n             What are the limitations of the evidence? \n           \n           Our confidence in the evidence is very low because we could only include 14 studies with few participants and few events, such as deaths or need for ventilation. The methods differed between studies, and they did not report everything we were interested in, such as quality of life.\u00a0 \n           \n             How up to date is this evidence? \n           \n           The evidence is up to date to 26 May 2021.",
    "response": "Most doctors loathe pharmaceutical companies too, FYI. Big pharma sucks. \n\nBut when it comes to the COVID vaccines, we have loads of data, from clinical trials paid for by pharma companies, and from real world studies from various countries with 0 connections to pharma companies. You do NOT have to trust pharma companies, but you can still trust these vaccines because they have been thoroughly tested for safety and efficacy by countless researchers all over the world. \n\nAdditionally, COVID-19 is a devastating disease, and as an unvaccinated diabetic, you\u2019re at a super high risk for hospitalization or death from COVID. If you get vaccinated, your chances of getting COVID go down dramatically, and your chances of hospitalization/death go down to around 0%. \n\nThe delta variant is over 100% more infectious than the original strain of the coronavirus. At this stage in the pandemic, it is EXTREMELY unlikely you get through this pandemic without either getting vaccinated or getting COVID. So you\u2019re choosing between having a sore arm for a day with the vaccine, or potentially dying with COVID. And for what? To spite Pfizer? I assure you your life is worth more than that.\n\nAs for your trip, unnecessary travel by unvaccinated individuals has been irresponsible since March of 2020, and that has not changed. You should not travel for leisure unless you are fully vaccinated (two weeks after your final dose)."

    "document": "The Effects of Stress on Physical Activity and Exercise\nBackground \n             Psychological stress and physical activity (PA) are believed to be reciprocally related; however, most research examining the relationship between these constructs is devoted to the study of exercise and/or PA as an instrument to mitigate distress. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             The aim of this paper was to review the literature investigating the influence of stress on indicators of PA and exercise. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             A systematic search of Web of Science, Pub-Med, and SPORTDiscus was employed to find all relevant studies focusing on human participants. Search terms included \u201cstress\u201d, \u201cexercise\u201d, and \u201cphysical activity\u201d. A rating scale (0\u20139) modified for this study was utilized to assess the quality of all studies with multiple time points. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The literature search found 168 studies that examined the influence of stress on PA. Studies varied widely in their theoretical orientation and included perceived stress, distress, life events, job strain, role strain, and work\u2013family conflict but not lifetime cumulative adversity. To more clearly address the question, prospective studies ( n  = 55) were considered for further review, the majority of which indicated that psychological stress predicts less PA (behavioral inhibition) and/or exercise or more sedentary behavior (76.4 %). Both objective (i.e., life events) and subjective (i.e., distress) measures of stress related to reduced PA. Prospective studies investigating the effects of objective markers of stress nearly all agreed (six of seven studies) that stress has a negative effect on PA. This was true for research examining (a) PA at periods of objectively varying levels of stress (i.e., final examinations vs. a control time point) and (b) chronically stressed populations (e.g., caregivers, parents of children with a cancer diagnosis) that were less likely to be active than controls over time. Studies examining older adults (>50 years), cohorts with both men and women, and larger sample sizes ( n  > 100) were more likely to show an inverse association. 85.7 % of higher-quality prospective research (\u22657 on a 9-point scale) showed the same trend. Interestingly, some prospective studies (18.2 %) report evidence that PA was positively impacted by stress (behavioral activation). This should not be surprising as some individuals utilize exercise to cope with stress. Several other factors may moderate stress and PA relationships, such as stages of change for exercise. Habitually active individuals exercise more in the face of stress, and those in beginning stages exercise less. Consequently, stress may have a differential impact on exercise adoption, maintenance, and relapse. Preliminary evidence suggests that combining stress management programming with exercise interventions may allay stress-related reductions in PA, though rigorous testing of these techniques has yet to be produced. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Overall, the majority of the literature finds that the experience of stress impairs efforts to be physically active. Future work should center on the development of a theory explaining the mechanisms underlying the multifarious influences of stress on PA behaviors.",

    "document": "Pruritus: Management Algorithms and Experimental Therapies\nPruritus (itch) is a major symptom in many dermatologic as well as systemic diseases and has a dramatic impact on the quality of life in these patients. The symptom of itch has to be treated on the basis of its pathophysiology and its underlying disease. In daily practice, a \u201cquick\u201d diagnosis of the underlying disease is often difficult, although a rapid relief of the itch is desired. We often treat patients on the basis of the symptomatology. A rational therapeutic ladder for a symptomatic therapy is useful until the final diagnosis has been confirmed. There are probably many subtypes of pruritus, just as there are many diseases that cause itch. The pathophysiology in many subtypes of pruritus is still poorly understood, hindering a rapid and targeted treatment strategy. An extensive diagnostic workup is often required to determine the final cause(s) of the itch. Thus, in daily life, physicians often start with a more or less rational therapeutic strategy to combat the debilitating itch. We present possible therapeutic ladders that form the basis for effective therapeutic itch strategies in various diseases. On the basis of our current knowledge about the different pathophysiologies of itch, on clinical trials or case reports, and our own clinical experience, we aim to present therapeutic ladders for the rapid as well as long-term management of itch. Finally, we summarize current exciting developments of experimental strategies in itch research and in clinical development for itch therapy.",

We performed analyses of 232,964 cases and 494,162 controls from genome-wide studies of anorexia nervosa, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, and Tourette syndrome. Genetic correlation analyses revealed a meaningful structure within the eight disorders, identifying three groups of inter-related disorders. Meta-analysis across these eight disorders detected 109 loci associated with at least two psychiatric disorders, including 23 loci with pleiotropic effects on four or more disorders and 11 loci with antagonistic effects on multiple disorders. The pleiotropic loci are located within genes that show heightened expression in the brain throughout the lifespan, beginning prenatally in the second trimester, and play prominent roles in neurodevelopmental processes.

Yet, accessing the long-lived photoinduced electronic states is still in its early stages, especially with respect to an insulator to metal phase transition. Here, by combining transport measurement with ultrashort photoexcitation and coherent phonon spectroscopy, we report on photoinduced multistage phase transitions in Ta 2 NiSe 5 . Upon excitation by weak pulse intensity, the system is triggered to a short-lived state accompanied by a structural change. Further increasing the excitation intensity beyond a threshold, a photoinduced steady new state is achieved where the resistivity drops by more than four orders at temperature 50 K. This new state is thermally stable up to at least 350 K and exhibits a lattice structure different from any of the thermally accessible equilibrium states. Transmission electron microscopy reveals an in-chain Ta atom displacement in the photoinduced new structure phase. We also found that nano-sheet samples with the thickness less than the optical penetration depth are required for attaining a complete transition. \n        \n           Examples of photoinduced insulator-to-metal transitions with a long-lived metallic state are rare.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are the most common cause of genital ulcers in adults but acquisition and chronic infection are more commonly asymptomatic than symptomatic. Both the symptomatic and asymptomatic forms of HSV are of clinical consequence for several reasons. HSV-2 infection enhances HIV-1 acquisition, as well as transmission. In addition, both sexual and perinatal transmission can occur during asymptomatic viral shedding. Perinatal transmission is of particular concern because neonatal HSV infection results in severe morbiditiy to the newborn.

It didn't get much attention, probably because of the hour I posted it at. One doctor responded and said it was \"unlikely\" that I could get tetanus from this wound. But I want as many second opinions as I can get. Thank you to the original doctor who answered me, but I'm looking for as many opinions as possible.\n\nBecause see, I'm at a moral crossroads. I got cut Friday night and now it's Sunday morning at 7am. I've been stressing about this constantly, to the point of insanity.\n\nI've been stressing so hard because while I did get all my mandated tetanus vaccines as a child, the last shot I had was when I was 10-11. I'm 23 now. I did some math. In the U.S. and many other countries, the government recommends booster shots every 10 years, and pretty much a booster every time you get cut by something dirty. So according to the U.S., I should be getting a booster right right now. Or I should have as soon as the wound was created. It's a little late now.\n\nAnyway, I've found some data that suggests that you don't actually need a booster every 10 years. Your five shots from when you were a child should actually keep you immune for 30 years, supposedly. That's uplifting, but I'm not entirely sure how credible it is. \n\n The problem is, it's the weekend. I'd have to go to urgent care or an emergency room to get medical attention right now. That's very expensive. \n\nAlso, I don't have insurance, and it's also Sunday. So my only options are spending an absolute ton of money just to get a booster shot that may not even help this situation at this point.\n\nI've been told that getting a booster after a wound does absolutely nothing for you because it takes weeks upon weeks for the antibodies to be created after vaccination. So I am not sure why it says everywhere online to get a shot as soon as possible after a suspected exposure to tetanus.\n\nThere seems to be an option to get tetanus immunoglobin, which is supposed to stop the tetanus in it's tracks, but doesn't destroy toxins already created in your body. So supposedly of you get an injection of this stuff, it can prevent tetanus sickness altogether if you get it early before symptoms start.\n\nHere's the thing though. That would probably cost me a lot of money to get tetanus immunoglobin, and I'm not sure if I can even get it by just telling a physician I'm super worried about this minor cut because the thing I cut myself on was filthy.\n\nSo, my question for all the physicians here is:\n\nReally, what should I do? I mean it's already been almost 48 hours since the cut.\n\nSeems like my options are:\n\nDo nothing and wait 21 days to see if I get lockjaw. For a hypochondriac like me this is going to be like playing Russian roulette with my brain every morning when I wake up thinking \"today is gonna be the day I get lockjaw\".\n\nSpend a lot of money and attempt to get some kind of preventative for tetanus infection. Is this even necessary? Well, I don't know. I don't know what my chances are of getting tetanus, and I don't know how much anything I can do will help. The cut really does seem minor. I know this. It's the thing I cut myself on that has me losing my mind. That air conditioner seems like the ideal living quarters for the tetanus abomination.\n\nAre there any other options? You would probably know.\n\nPlease, give me as many opinions as possible. Call me an idiot, a hypochondriac, I don't care. I know these things. I spend so much time stressing about my health that it might just kill me. But these past two nights have been an anxiety ridden hell. I can't stand the thought of getting tetanus a week from now. It's one of my greatest fears, and it's driving me nuts all because I doofed and scraped my leg on an old air conditioner.\n\nNow, the rest of this post will be explaining the wound, how I got it, how I cleaned it, and what I cut myself with. There is a picture of the exact corner of the AC that I cut myself on, because I'm wondering if this is a place tetanus lives. It is actually quite dusty despite not looking like it in the picture.\n\nSorry for coming back here. I'm losing my mind. Please help me.\n\nThis is a picture of the wound just after I had gotten it to stop bleeding:\n\n\n\nThis is a picture of the wound just now as I've just got done washing it off\n\nCurrent: \n\nSo I was walking around my room a little bit ago. It was kinda dark.\n\nThere was an air conditioner laying on the ground because my girlfriend had moved it into the bedroom to prepare to put it in the window. It's your basic window AC.\n\nAnyway, I walked past the thing and bumped into the sharp corner on the back of it with my leg. It hit my shin and left a very small and shallow scratch that did bleed a tiny bit but nothing extreme.\n\nThis is a picture of the exact corner I cut my leg on. It is much dustier than it looks in the picture.\n\n\n\nAnyway, so I immediately noticed this and took a look. Sure as shit, I was bleeding a little bit, so I knew I had to disinfect since it was cut by the back end of a piece of metal that had been outside months ago.\n\nI immediately went into the bathroom and poured isopropyl alcohol onto it. I then took a rag, poured isopropyl alcohol on the rag, and pressed it down firmly into the small wound, and then I would lift up the rag every minute or so to check if the blood was no longer coming off on the rag, meaning I had gotten it to scab.\n\nAfter a couple minutes, probably three or so minutes, the bleeding had stopped, and I held the rag on it for a little longer just because I'm a psycho.\n\nI proceeded to just leave it alone after this. I didn't put a band-aid on it or dress it in any way.\n\nThe reason I reacted so promptly is because I know there could maybe just maybe be tetanus on the back of that air conditioner. The AC hasn't been in a window for months, but still I panicked nonetheless. It's been sitting in the house since August.\n\nIf you look on the back of this AC, you can see some parts of it that are a little dirty, but there is no large amount of soil on the machine. It's just dusty.\n\nAnyway, I know this is a very shallow wound, but I did cut myself on something that could potentially carry tetanus so I still freaked out.\n\nI know fully well that I was at the very least vaccinated at some point in my life, probably before age 15, it could have even been before I was a teenager, 5 or 6 years old. But I know I got one.\n\nI typically have an unreasonably strong immune system despite my random careless diet and lack of hand washing, I haven't caught a bug of any kind since I was 19. Before I was 19, I only got sick maybe once every 3-5 years, even when other people in the house are sick I'm almost always immune for some reason.\n\nI just need to know if based on what I've told you and shown you here, is there any risk of me getting tetanus from this?  Tetanus is one of my greatest fears, and I think it would be the worst way to go. Also, could my isopropyl alcohol attack have just killed any tetanus off anyway?\n\nPlease let me know. I'm paranoid. \n\nIt's even worse because I know that the Coronavirus is going around. While I am not alarmed by the COVID-19 by itself, I am almost certain that if my body were infected with both COVID-19 AND tetanus at the same time, I would surely keel over. My thought process here is that if I end up with tetanus I will certainly be whisked away to a hospital, where tons of Corona patients will be, and I will most certainly be infected with Corona aswell.\n\nAlso, should I go further with cleaning the wound, say putting a bandaid on it? I actually don't have any at the moment but still a question nonetheless.",
    "document": "The importance of tetanus risk assessment during wound management\nPublic Health England undertakes surveillance of vaccine preventable diseases including enhanced surveillance of clinically suspected tetanus. In the United Kingdom, tetanus has become increasingly rare due to the success of the national routine immunization program. Consequently, few practitioners have experience of diagnosing and managing patients with clinical tetanus. We report two cases of tetanus where comparatively minor wounds proved fatal. These cases highlight the importance of the accurate identification and management of tetanus prone wounds and the fatal consequences from untreated injuries in susceptible individuals. We conclude that appropriate risk assessment for tetanus prophylaxis forms an essential part of wound management.",
    "response": "Dude, calm down. You're going to be fine. It is highly unlikely that a wound this minor is going to be of any significance. You're due for a tetanus booster on a non emergent basis, but that has nothing to do with this scrape."

    "question": "My son is seven years old and is uncircumcised.  His pediatrician was concerned his foreskin may not be \"loosening\" to be able to retract as much as it should, so she referred us to a pediatric urologist for a specialist's opinion.  During the visit with the urologist today, the doctor forcibly pulled his foreskin back, exposing much more of the head of his penis than we've seen before.  He expressed pain when the doctor did this, and my son now says it burns when he pees.  My wife is a nurse and was taught the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis will retract completely around puberty and it is never to be forcibly pulled back.  Do we have reason to be concerned?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all of the responses. My son is still experiencing some pain while trying to retract his foreskin, but I think it's not as bad as yesterday. We've read about the possibility of scarring when forcibly retracting the foreskin, so we were and are still very concerned, but many of the responses here have put us at ease some.",
    "document": "Pathologic and physiologic phimosis\nOBJECTIVE \n             To review the differences between physiologic and pathologic phimosis, review proper foreskin care, and discuss when it is appropriate to seek consultation regarding a phimotic foreskin. \n           \n           \n             SOURCES OF INFORMATION \n             This paper is based on selected findings from a MEDLINE search for literature on phimosis and circumcision referrals and on our experience at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Eastern Ontario Urology Clinic. MeSH headings used in our MEDLINE search included \u201cphimosis,\u201d \u201creferral and consultation,\u201d and \u201ccircumcision.\u201d Most of the available articles about phimosis and foreskin referrals were retrospective reviews and cohort studies (levels II and III evidence). \n           \n           \n             MAIN MESSAGE \n             Phimosis is defined as the inability to retract the foreskin. Differentiating between physiologic and pathologic phimosis is important, as the former is managed conservatively and the latter requires surgical intervention. Great anxiety exists among patients and parentsregarding non-retractile foreskins. Most phimosis referrals seen in pediatric urology clinics are normal physiologically phimotic foreskins. Referrals of patients with physiologic phimosis to urology clinics can create anxiety about the need for surgery among patients and parents, while unnecessarily expanding the waiting list for specialty assessment. Uncircumcised penises require no special care. With normal washing, using soap and water, and gentle retraction during urination and bathing, most foreskins will become retractile over time. \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSION \n             Physiologic phimosis is often seen by family physicians. These patients and their parents require reassurance of normalcy and reinforcement of proper preputial hygiene. Consultation should be sought when evidence of pathologic phimosis is present, as this requires surgical management.",
    "response": "Theres no need to be concerned at this point. the urilogist needs to asses how far the foreskin can go at this point, to determine what are the options going forward, and differentiate between a physiologic and a pathologic phymosis. There may be a bit of stinging for a couple of days, which should have been mentioned, but other than that it is extremely unlikely that there's any damage. A lot of infants foreskins can't retract all the way but for most kids it happens sometime well /before/ puberty, usually around 3 years of age, though the frequency tapers off from then until around 10. \n\nYou might find this an interesting read;"

Different compositions (5% wt., 10% wt., 15% wt. and 20% wt.) of the recycled \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  nanoparticles were melt-blended with PCL using a twin screw extruder to fabricate recycled \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 /PCL nanocomposites. The samples were characterized for their microstructural properties through X - ray diffraction (XRD) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The complex permittivity and microwave absorption properties were respectively measured using the open ended coaxial (OEC) probe and a microstrip in connection with a vector network analyzer in the 1\u20134 GHz frequency range. An average \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  nanoparticle size of 16.2 nm was obtained with a maximum imaginary (\u03b5 \" ) part of permittivity value of 0.54 at 4 GHz. The complex permittivity and power loss values of the nanocomposites increased with recycled \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3  nanofiller content. At 2.4 GHz, the power loss (dB) values obtained for all the nanocomposites were between 13.3 dB and 14.4 dB and at 3.4 GHz, a maximum value of 16.37 dB was achieved for the 20 % wt. nanocomposite.

The pain was in my sinuses and felt like hammers hitting my face. I mistook it for a sinus infection, but CT scans were clear. a couple months later and it morphed into more widespread headaches into my forehead, back of the head, top of the head. I got attacks twice a week at this time and took ibuprofen, Tylenol and sudafed. This was mid March 2018. also was getting the classic aura. \nENT referred me to pediatric neurologist (but when I called the hospital they scheduled me w a CPNP who specialized in neurology or something), who sent me for brain MRI (normal) and then put me on magnesium for prevention, naproxen & compazine for abortive. \n\nbetween that and my followup, my migraines progressively got worse, going up to 5 headache days a week, sometimes being status migraines. I went to the  headache clinic at the hospital and got nerve blocks, zofran, and cefaly  \n\nat my followup the CPNP refused to put me on an actual preventative (I\u2019m not trying to talk down to people who get relief from magnesium, it\u2019s just that I wasn\u2019t and I wanted a preventative that worked for me) switched the abortive (that wasn\u2019t working for me) from naproxen to ibuprofen (didn\u2019t work either) and refused to give me triptans or any migraine specific drug. Although she did allow me to schedule another nerve block which did give me 3 days of relief, but cefaly (trigeminal nerve stimulator) did not work for me. \n\n\nme and my mother decided to seek care elsewhere. since we just weren\u2019t vibing. \nmy new pediatric neurologist put me on amitriptyline (failed, then switched to trokendi) riboflavin, & maxalt for abortion \n\nTrokendi greatly reduced the intensity of my migraines but not so much the frequency, as I got around 4 migraines a week. \n\nwhen I went back to my neurologist we agreed on doing botox next. but in between the followup and my botox I got an intractable starts migraine. I then tried DHE nasal spray, gammacore vagus nerve stimulator and Thorazine. This all didn\u2019t work so I got admitted to the hospital for a DHE infusion, also receiving zofran, Benadryl and reglan. i stayed for 3 days and left with my migraine gone. It came back a couple days later and I did a olanzapine(didnt work) and nerve block which lasted a couple days. It came back and I got admitted to the hospital again to do another DHE infusion. I had really bad vomiting and nausea this time due to the DHE and migraine. it aborted the migraine for a day but then it came back again I did a medrol pac and it worked great. \n\naround thanksgiving I did another nerve block (worked for around another 2 days) but when that stopped working and it came back I did a medrol pac again which did not work. \nmy neurologist then decided to have me try an aimovig injection just to see if it will abort my migraine (it did for about a day) and I went on gabapentin. Around this time I began going blind during my migraines for around 2 hours. \n\n\nI did another nerve block almost a week ago, it lasted around 4 days, and I talked to my neurologist about other options. we talked about nerve decompression surgery if my next round of Botox fails. I\u2019m deeply considering it. I want my life back. I want to stop carrying around this luggage. I want to stop the painsomnia. Migraines have taken away my youth, My sports, my school and this surgery has the chance to return it to me. Even if it just reduced the intensity or the frequency would be a huge huge improvement to me. \n\nI\u2019m mostly asking if there\u2019s anything else I should try before going through with it, or reasons not to. \n\n\nForgot to mention some other things I have tried: norflex (for my shoulders mostly, they are rocks) meclizine, promethazine, Benadryl, toradol, zomig, physical therapy and suboccipital release, chiropractic. I\u2019ve also had my eyes fully worked up and I do have some mild diplopia. \n\nI am not able to continue doing the aimovig as a preventative because my insurance does not cover it. It\u2019s not approved for kids yet. \n\n\nTLDR: I have chronic, refractory, status, intractable migraines. I have tried trokendi, gabapentin, compazine, promethazine, reglan, zofran, toradol, ibuprofen, naproxen, tylenol, olanzapine, Thorazine, zomig, maxalt, migranal, DHE infusions, amitriptyline, botox, cefaly, norflex, aimovig, gammacore, coQ10, riboflavin, mag-g.

    "document": "Prophylactic Treatment of Pediatric Migraine: Is There Anything New in the Last Decade?\nMigraine is a frequent and very disabling disease, especially at pediatric age. Despite this, there are few controlled data on the prophylactic treatment of primary headaches in this category of age. Given that the recently introduced calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibitors (CGRP-r) are still limited to adulthood, there is no drug with exclusive indication for migraine treatment in pediatric age. This raises several limitations in terms of adherence and effectiveness of the therapy. Moreover, the scenario is complicated by placebo response, which is larger in children and adolescents than in adults and often leads to an improvement in the attack frequency even in absence of any active pharmacological treatment. Our aim was to investigate the real evidence concerning the prophylactic therapy of pediatric migraine by reviewing the clinical studies published between 2010 and 2019.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether the associations of screen time with cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality were modified by levels of cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength or physical activity. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             In total, 390,089 participants (54% women) from the UK Biobank were included in this study. All-cause mortality, CVD and cancer incidence and mortality were the main outcomes. Discretionary television (TV) viewing, personal computer (PC) screen time and overall screen time (TV\u2009+\u2009PC time) were the exposure variables. Grip strength, fitness and physical activity were treated as potential effect modifiers. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Altogether, 7420 participants died, and there were 22,210 CVD events, over a median of 5.0\u00a0years follow-up (interquartile range 4.3 to 5.7; after exclusion of the first 2\u00a0years from\u00a0baseline in the landmark analysis). All discretionary screen-time exposures were\u00a0significantly associated with all health outcomes. The associations of overall discretionary screen time with all-cause mortality and incidence of CVD and cancer were strongest amongst participants in the lowest tertile for grip strength (all-cause mortality hazard ratio per 2-h increase in screen time (1.31 [95% confidence interval: 1.22\u20131.43],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001; CVD 1.21 [1.13\u20131.30],  p \u2009=\u20090.0001; cancer incidence 1.14 [1.10\u20131.19],  p \u2009<\u20090.0001) and weakest amongst those in the highest grip-strength tertile (all-cause mortality 1.04 [0.95\u20131.14],  p \u2009=\u20090.198; CVD 1.05 [0.99\u20131.11],  p \u2009=\u20090.070; cancer 0.98 [0.93\u20131.05],  p \u2009=\u20090.771).

Although hospital physician staffing and composition may be affected by meetings, patient outcomes and treatment patterns during meeting dates are unknown. \n           \n           \n             OBJECTIVE \n             To analyze mortality and treatment differences among patients admitted with acute cardiovascular conditions during dates of national cardiology meetings compared with nonmeeting dates. \n           \n           \n             DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS \n             Retrospective analysis of 30-day mortality among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, or cardiac arrest from 2002 through 2011 during dates of 2 national cardiology meetings compared with identical nonmeeting days in the 3 weeks before and after conferences (AMI, 8570 hospitalizations during 82 meeting days and 57 471 during 492 nonmeeting days; heart failure, 19 282 during meeting days and 11 4591 during nonmeeting days; cardiac arrest, 1564 during meeting days and 9580 during nonmeeting days).

In teaching hospitals, adjusted 30-day mortality was lower among high-risk patients with heart failure or cardiac arrest admitted during meeting vs nonmeeting dates (heart failure, 17.5% [95% CI, 13.7%\u201321.2%] vs 24.8% [95% CI, 22.9%\u201326.6%];  P  < .001; cardiac arrest, 59.1% [95% CI, 51.4%\u201366.8%] vs 69.4% [95% CI, 66.2%\u201372.6%];  P  = .01). Adjusted mortality for high-risk AMI in teaching hospitals was similar between meeting and nonmeeting dates (39.2% [95% CI, 31.8%\u201346.6%] vs 38.5% [95% CI, 35.0%\u201342.0%];  P  = .86), although adjusted percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) rates were lower during meetings (20.8% vs 28.2%;  P  = .02). No mortality or utilization differences existed for low-risk patients in teaching hospitals or high- or low-risk patients in nonteaching hospitals. In sensitivity analyses, cardiac mortality was not affected by hospitalization during oncology, gastroenterology, and orthopedics meetings, nor was gastrointestinal hemorrhage or hip fracture mortality affected by hospitalization during cardiology meetings. \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE \n             High-risk patients with heart failure and cardiac arrest hospitalized in teaching hospitals had lower 30-day mortality when admitted during dates of national cardiology meetings. High-risk patients with AMI admitted to teaching hospitals during meetings were less likely to receive PCI, without any mortality effect.",
    "response": "This is a difficult situation and very hard to know exactly what happened without waayyyy more details.   I'm really sorry you guys are going through this.  \n\nFirst of all, complications of stent placement are real, and happen frequently.  One of those is blockage of the artery by the stent or a new clot.  Complications can happen after cath procedures even if everything is done right.  \n\nSecond, it's hard to know why people weren't moving faster.  Perhaps there was some result that didn't make sense, and they didn't want to rush to an angiogram (which can be dangerous sometimes too).  \n\nThird, healthcare workers screw up all the time.  It's a bunch of humans.  Sometimes they're lazy.  Or not well-trained.  Or put in impossible situations by their institution.

They have performed multiple MRIs, MRV\u2019s, blood tests, blood transfusions, 2 rounds of paracentesis, have cultured the fluid that has been drained, done a barium enema, colon biopsy, tested the functioning of his liver, kidneys, and intestines\u2026 And still have not been able to reach any conclusion as to where this fluid is accumulating from. \u201cThe clinical picture just does not match his scans/tests,\u201d they say, \u201cthis baby is a mystery!\u201d One thing is certain, however; Micah\u2019s condition is critical and he is running out of time as his belly grows bigger and bigger every day. The fluid is now pushing up on his lungs and limiting their ability to expand and grow. We are seeking second, third, even fourth opinions at this time, but that is not easy to do given the global status, and transferring to another hospital is currently much too challenging an option. Therefore, we are sending out this call for help and ask that you please re-post this plea to your stories and pages in hopes that it may reach someone who may have even some nugget of a notion as to what Micah is experiencing. Let\u2019s try to use the power of social media for some good and help our poor baby boy please. Micah is a very strong fighter who has already beaten many odds, but just needs some extra support in figuring out what is causing this condition. We truly appreciate everyone\u2019s love and support throughout our journey, and really hope that we can find a successful solution to heal our sweet baby and bring him home with us one day.",
    "document": "Diagnosis and management of congenital neonatal chylous ascites\nBackground:  Congenital chylous ascites is a rare condition that constitutes a challenge for the physician. It is defined as the accumulation of chyle into the peritoneal cavity in infants younger than 3 months. This condition is often refractory to therapy and it is responsible for serious malnutrition and immunological deficiency because of the loss of proteins and lymphocytes. \n           Material and methods:  Four cases of congenital neonatal chylous ascites, were treated by our staff during the last two years. One case was treated conservatively and three with laparotomy. Two of them had intraabdominal cysts that were excised and one was treated with ligation of the left lumbar lymphatic trunk and cisterna chyli and the use of fibrin glue. \n           Results:  All four cases were treated successfully. On follow up tests no one showed recurrence of the ascites. All children, except the one that treated conservatively and also had other problems due to prematurity, are growing up normally. \n           Conclusions:  Congenital chylous ascites is a complex condition. Its diagnostic evaluation is difficult and its therapy of long duration. Conservative treatment is in most cases the initial choice, but when it fails, exploratory laparotomy could provide a successful alternative.",

    "document": "Face touching: A frequent habit that has implications for hand hygiene\nBackground \n             There is limited literature on the frequency of face-touching behavior as a potential vector for the self-inoculation and transmission of  Staphylococcus aureus  and other common respiratory infections. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             A behavioral observation study was undertaken involving medical students at the University of New South Wales. Their face-touching behavior was observed via videotape recording. Using standardized scoring sheets, the frequency of hand-to-face contacts with mucosal or nonmucosal areas was tallied and analyzed. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             On average, each of the 26 observed students touched their face 23 times per hour. Of all face touches, 44% (1,024/2,346) involved contact with a mucous membrane, whereas 56% (1,322/2,346) of contacts involved nonmucosal areas. Of mucous membrane touches observed, 36% (372) involved the mouth, 31% (318) involved the nose, 27% (273) involved the eyes, and 6% (61) were a combination of these regions. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Increasing medical students' awareness of their habituated face-touching behavior and improving their understanding of self-inoculation as a route of transmission may help to improve hand hygiene compliance. Hand hygiene programs aiming to improve compliance with before and after patient contact should include a message that mouth and nose touching is a common practice.

    "document": "Voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans\nSignificance \n           Hitherto, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune system were regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. The present study demonstrates that, through practicing techniques learned in a short-term training program, the sympathetic nervous system and immune system can indeed be voluntarily influenced. Healthy volunteers practicing the learned techniques exhibited profound increases in the release of epinephrine, which in turn led to increased production of anti-inflammatory mediators and subsequent dampening of the proinflammatory cytokine response elicited by intravenous administration of bacterial endotoxin. This study could have important implications for the treatment of a variety of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, especially autoimmune diseases in which therapies that antagonize proinflammatory cytokines have shown great benefit. \n        \n           Excessive or persistent proinflammatory cytokine production plays a central role in autoimmune diseases. Acute activation of the sympathetic nervous system attenuates the innate immune response. However, both the autonomic nervous system and innate immune system are regarded as systems that cannot be voluntarily influenced. Herein, we evaluated the effects of a training program on the autonomic nervous system and innate immune response. Healthy volunteers were randomized to either the intervention ( n  = 12) or control group ( n  = 12). Subjects in the intervention group were trained for 10 d in meditation (third eye meditation), breathing techniques (i.a., cyclic hyperventilation followed by breath retention), and exposure to cold (i.a., immersions in ice cold water). The control group was not trained. Subsequently, all subjects underwent experimental endotoxemia (i.v. administration of 2 ng/kg  Escherichia coli  endotoxin). In the intervention group, practicing the learned techniques resulted in intermittent respiratory alkalosis and hypoxia resulting in profoundly increased plasma epinephrine levels. In the intervention group, plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 increased more rapidly after endotoxin administration, correlated strongly with preceding epinephrine levels, and were higher. Levels of proinflammatory mediators TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8 were lower in the intervention group and correlated negatively with IL-10 levels. Finally, flu-like symptoms were lower in the intervention group. In conclusion, we demonstrate that voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system results in epinephrine release and subsequent suppression of the innate immune response in humans in vivo. These results could have important implications for the treatment of conditions associated with excessive or persistent inflammation, such as autoimmune diseases.",

Gadopentetate dimeglumine is known to produce functional changes when injected into the cerebrospinal fluid, and we hypothesized that such changes might be associated with morphologic damage. \n           \n           \n             METHODS \n             Conscious rats, surgically prepared with a lateral ventricular cannula, were given a slow injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine into the lateral ventricle, and behavioral and neuropathologic changes were noted. \n           \n           \n             RESULTS \n             Gadopentetate dimeglumine produced signs of acute neurotoxicity over several hours (stereotyped movements and myoclonus), medium-term signs over several days (ataxia and tremor), and neuropathologic changes over 24 hours, with reactive changes persisting for 42 days. All of the above were dose-dependent over the range of 2.5 to 15 mumol/g brain. The lowest dose producing morphologic or behavioral changes was 5 mu mol/g brain. Iso-osmotic, isovolumetric injections of sucrose produced no such effects. Focal lesions occurred within the thalamus, brain stem, and spinal cord, with necrosis of glia, loss of myelin, and, usually, sparing of neurons and nerve fibers. Persisting ataxia was always associated with brain stem or spinal cord lesions. \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSION \n             Intraventricular administration of contrast medium allows toxicity to be evaluated in areas such as the spinal cord that are not accessible by osmotic opening. While it is unlikely that these toxic effects would be seen at the doses used for clinical imaging by the intravenous route, gadopentetate dimeglumine clearly has some neurotoxic and neuropathologic potential. Although the acute excitation could be attributed to a transiently high local concentration of the agent at the injection site, the lesions were widely distributed through the brain and spinal cord and may reflect a region-specific neurotoxic action, possibly related to central pontine myelinolysis.",

Postmortem human or animal studies have validated gadolinium deposition in these T1-hyperintensity areas, raising new concerns on the safety of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs).

    "document": "Gadolinium-based contrast agent toxicity: a review of known and proposed mechanisms\nGadolinium chelates are widely used as contrast media for magnetic resonance imaging. The approved gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) have historically been considered safe and well tolerated when used at recommended dosing levels. However, for nearly a decade, an association between GBCA administration and the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) has been recognized in patients with severe renal impairment. This has led to modifications in clinical practices aimed at reducing the potential and incidence of NSF development. Newer reports have emerged regarding the accumulation of gadolinium in various tissues of patients who do not have renal impairment, including bone, brain, and kidneys. Despite the observations of gadolinium accumulation in tissues regardless of renal function, very limited clinical data regarding the potential for and mechanisms of toxicity is available. This significant gap in knowledge warrants retrospective cohort study efforts, as well as prospective studies that involve gadolinium ion (Gd 3+ ) testing in patients exposed to GBCA. This review examines the potential biochemical and molecular basis of gadolinium toxicity, possible clinical significance of gadolinium tissue retention and accumulation, and methods that can limit gadolinium body burden.",

    "document": "Rare, common, alien and native species follow different rules in an understory plant community\nAbstract \n           Biological invasions are a leading threat to biodiversity globally. Increasingly, ecosystems experience multiple introductions, which can have significant effects on patterns of diversity. The way these communities assemble will depend partly on whether rare and common alien species respond to environmental predictors in the same manner as rare and common native species, but this is not well understood. To examine this question across four national parks in south\u2010eastern Australia, we sampled the understory plant community of eucalypt\u2010dominated dry forest subject to multiple plant introductions. The drivers of diversity and turnover in alien and native species of contrasting frequency of occurrence (low, intermediate, and high) were each tested individually. We found alien species diversity and turnover were both strongly associated with abiotic conditions (e.g., soil pH), while distance had little influence because of the greater extent of occurrence and more homogeneous composition of common aliens. In contrast, native species diversity was not associated with abiotic conditions and their turnover was as strongly influenced by distance as by abiotic conditions. In both alien and native species, however, the most important predictors of turnover changed with frequency of occurrence. Although local coexistence appears to be facilitated by life history trade\u2010offs, species richness of aliens and natives was negatively correlated and native species might face greater competition in areas with more neutral soils (e.g., pH\u00a0>\u00a0~5.5) where alien richness and relative frequency were both highest. We conclude that diversity and turnover in the generally more widespread alien species are mainly driven by species sorting along an environmental gradient associated with pH and nutrient availability, whereas turnover of native species is driven by more neutral processes associated with dispersal limitation. We show alien and native plant species respond to different environmental factors, as do rare and common species within each component. \n        \n           Many parks and forests have experienced centuries of multispecies invasions. Using a multi\u2010site turnover metric, we differentiate between the structure and drivers of the geographically rare and common alien and native understorey plants. Distinct differences were identified between the alien and native species; namely that natives were driven by distance, while aliens were driven by environmental filtering and soil pH constrained both common natives and rare and common aliens.",

I wrote those off as being symptoms of my gastritis but they seem more ominous now looking back on it.\n\nI messaged my doctor asking about the possibility of food poisoning causing these issues and testing and was met with \"I don't think food poisoning is causing these issues.\" I'm getting an MRI on the 20th to check my brain but whether they find something or not, how do I know food poisoning isn't causing more serious issues? Why are these things happening to me?\n\nAge: 21\n\nSex: M\n\nHeight: 5'7\n\nWeight: 122 lbs\n\nRace: Caucasian\n\nDuration of complaint: 1 month\n\nLocation: Bay Area, CA\n\nAny existing relevant medical issues: Mild chronic gastritis, exercise-induced hives\n\nCurrent medications: None",
    "document": "Evaluation of mercury exposure level, clinical diagnosis and treatment for mercury intoxication\nMercury occurs in various chemical forms, and it is different to health effects according to chemical forms. In consideration of the point, the evaluation of the mercury exposure to human distinguished from occupational and environmental exposure. \n           With strict to manage occupational exposure in factory, it is declined mercury intoxication cases by metallic and inorganic mercury inhalation to occupational exposure. It is increasing to importance in environmental exposure and public health. \n           The focus on the health impact of exposure to mercury is more on chronic, low or moderate grade exposure\u2014albeit a topic of great controversy\u2014, not high concentration exposure by methylmercury, which caused Minamata disease. \n           Recently, the issue of mercury toxicity according to the mercury exposure level, health effects as well as the determination of what mercury levels affect health are in the spotlight and under active discussion. Evaluating the health effects and Biomarker of mercury exposure and establishing diagnosis and treatment standards are very difficult. \n           It can implement that evaluating mercury exposure level for diagnosis by a provocation test uses chelating agent and conducting to appropriate therapy according to the result. but, indications for the therapy of chelating agents with mercury exposure have not yet been fully established. \n           The therapy to symptomatic patients with mercury poisoning is chelating agents, combination therapy with chelating agents, plasma exchange, hemodialysis, plasmapheresis. But the further evaluations are necessary for the effects and side effects with each therapy.",

    "question": "Hello, I'm at a complete loss as to what is going on with me, as are doctors. I've seen all sorts of consults and had many scans, which haven't revealed much. Below is a list of my symptoms:\n\n\u2022 hands - weakness, loss of grip when holding things, fingers twitching/spasming, pain 90% of the time around level 5/10 but jumps up to 8-9/10 when used, fingers need to 'crack' as they feel stuck and painful\n\u2022 arms - pain in elbows and wrists, twitching / spasms, wrists tend to 'flick' and I end up dropping whatever I'm holding\n\u2022 head - I get dizzy everyday either by standing up or by exercise, these dizzy spells can give me a blurred vision that is almost like it's going grey. It's kind of like the vision you get when you black out, except I don't lose consciousness. I also slur my speech on a regular occasion, generally because of exercise. This exercise can be anything from walking for 5 mins - 60min, going up stairs, walking around my house\n\u2022 back - lower back pain on the right that extends to the hip, groin and thigh. Exercise makes it worse, especially walking up any kind of incline\n\nI was diagnosed with fibromyalgia just under 10 years ago and have suffered from chronic migraines for around 5 years. The symptoms I've described are either new (since Dec 19) or have worsened since the same date.\n\nIn Dec 19 I had a coughing fit which caused something in my lower back to 'pop'. I've had a full back MRI and nothing has been found, other than \"the usual wear and year\". I am currently trying to gain access to my scans.\n\nI'm here because I am at a complete loss over what to do. I've become a prisoner in my own body. I can't live like this.",
    "document": "Biological relevance of ZNF224 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication IN NF-kB pathway regulation\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, whose presentation and clinical course are highly variable. Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",
