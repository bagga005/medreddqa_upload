    "question": "I am at a loss for words on how this could have happened. My 15 year old (asian female) cousin passed away two days ago, who was completely a normal healthy teenager--no drugs, no smoking, no drinking, nothing. \n\nTwo weeks ago, her friend at school gave her a treat where she suddenly had an allergic reaction with her airways closing up and received three shots to control her allergic reaction. Apparently she had an allergic reaction to peanuts--something she was never allergic to before. She felt better, but then picked up mono from school probably a week later. She was saying she felt tired all the time and that her senses were all out of wack. Within that two week period she ended up in the ER again, first time for fatigue but was sent home and was told that the fatigue was from mono and that it would pass. \n\nThe second time to the ER was worse--this time she was airlifted to one of the best hospitals in the country but no one could figure out what was wrong, except only that her health was declining fast. Her liver was no longer functioning, hundreds of tests were performed and the only thing that came back positive was mono. Her brain swelled up so bad that it herniated to her spine causing her to lose all body function and at that point lost all brain activity. The only thing keeping her alive was epinephrine, two other drugs and life support. She died 24 hours later where family and friends were notified to come visit to say goodbye.\n\nThe family has agreed to an autopsy but we are devasted on how sudden and fast her health deteriorated so quickly and are at a loss of how this was not prevented. Any medical advice on what may have happened from experienced medical professionals would be greatly appreciated as we are all looking for answers... How does she go from a complete healthy vibrant teenager to having liver failure and losing her life in such a short period?\n\nMy uncle's family of four (aunt, uncle, 20 y/o son, and 15   y/o daughter) is now a family of two. My uncle who passed away unexpectedly 7 years ago from alcohol problems, and now his 15 y/o daughter passing away unexpectedly just makes my heart ache that much more for their family. I'm hoping some sort of concrete answer will give us all the closure we are looking for especially for them.",
    "document": "Pathophysiology of cerebral oedema in acute liver failure\nCerebral oedema is a devastating consequence of acute liver failure (ALF) and may be associated with the development of intracranial hypertension and death. In ALF, some patients may develop cerebral oedema and increased intracranial pressure but progression to life-threatening intracranial hypertension is less frequent than previously described, complicating less than one third of cases who have proceeded to coma since the advent of improved clinical care. The rapid onset of encephalopathy may be dramatic with the development of asterixis, delirium, seizures and coma. Cytotoxic and vasogenic oedema mechanisms have been implicated with a preponderance of experimental data favouring a cytotoxic mechanism. Astrocyte swelling is the most consistent neuropathological finding in humans with ALF and ammonia plays a definitive role in the development of cytotoxic brain oedema. The mechanism(s) by which ammonia induces astrocyte swelling remains unclear but glutamine accumulation within astrocytes has led to the osmolyte hypothesis. Current evidence also supports an alternate \u2018Trojan horse\u2019 hypothesis, with glutamine as a carrier of ammonia into mitochondria, where its accumulation results in oxidative stress, energy failure and ultimately astrocyte swelling. Although a complete breakdown of the blood-brain barrier is not evident in human ALF, increased permeation to water and other small molecules such as ammonia has been demonstrated resulting from subtle alterations in the protein composition of paracellular tight junctions. At present, there is no fully efficacious therapy for cerebral oedema other than liver transplantation and this reflects our incomplete knowledge of the precise mechanisms underlying this process which remain largely unknown.",
    "response": "Based on your post above you have some significant misunderstandings of this condition. I would refrain from guessing as to what \"could have saved her\" if you don't have a firm understanding of the pathology. Comments like that may seem innocuous but they can cause great distress to a family when someone has recently passed. \n\nAnd to the OP, I would frankly not give much credence to the idea that she could have been saved by surgery. One of the comments here that pointed to fulminant hepatic failure caused be the Epstein Barr virus (which causes mono) is most likely correct. That is a very challenging medical situation with a very high mortality rate and it is impossible to say based on the information provided if anything could have saved her."

Insights into its mechanism of action can lead to drug discovery of alternative compounds with comparable efficacy but improved safety. The goal of this study is to compare the temporal changes in gene expression in the skin of acne patients after 1 week and 8 weeks of treatment with isotretinoin. Microarray analysis was performed on skin biopsies taken from eight acne patients prior to and at 8 weeks of treatment with isotretinoin. Results were compared with data obtained from seven acne patients biopsied at one week of treatment in a prior study. Distinctly different patterns of gene expression were noted. At 8 weeks, genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins were upregulated and numerous genes encoding lipid metabolizing enzymes were downregulated. At 1 week, genes encoding differentiation markers, tumor suppressors and serine proteases were upregulated. Only three genes were commonly downregulated. The temporal changes in gene expression in patient skin noted with isotretinoin substantiate many previously reported effects of isotretinoin and other retinoids, suggesting a model wherein isotretinoin induces apoptosis leading to reduced sebaceous gland size, decreased expression of lipid metabolizing enzymes and increased matrix remodeling during acne resolution.",

The aim of this study was to investigate racial/ethnic differences in RIs of common biochemical and hematological laboratory tests using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011\u20132012 data. This current study included 3,077 participants aged 18\u201365 years who reported their health status as \u201cExcellent,\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d or \u201cGood,\u201d with known race/ethnicity as white, black, Hispanic, or Asian. Quantile regression analyses adjusted for sex were conducted to evaluate racial/ethnic differences in the normal ranges of 38 laboratory tests. Significant racial/ethnic differences were found in almost all laboratory tests. Compared to whites, the normal range for Asians significantly shifted to higher values in globulin and total protein and to lower values in creatinine, hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin concentration, and mean platelet volume. These results indicate that racial/ethnic subpopulations have unique distributions in the labortoary tests and race/ethnicity may need to be incorporated in the development of their RIs. Establishment of racial/ethnic-specific RIs may have significant clinical and public health implication for more accurate disease diagnosis and appropriate treatment to improve quality of patient care, especially for a state with diverse racial/ethnic subpopuations such as Hawai\u2018i.",

    "document": "Latent Tuberculosis Infection - Diagnosis and Treatment\nINTRODUCTION: \n             Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is defined as a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens without evidence of clinically manifested active tuberculosis (TB). Diagnosis and treatment for LTBI are important for TB, especially in high-risk populations. Tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are used to diagnose LTBI. \n           \n           \n             AIM: \n             The study aims to present the first results with IGRA test compared with TST in the screening of LTBI and the treatment results in the cases with LTBI in Macedonia. \n           \n           \n             MATERIAL AND METHODS: \n             In this study 73 cases diagnosed and treated with LTBI in 2016 were included. For diagnosis of LTBI, we used TST RT -23 5T.U. and commercial IGRA test such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT). \n           \n           \n             RESULTS: \n             Out of 73 cases with LTBI, 61.64% were men, and 38.36% were women. Among all age groups, the most frequent were cases between 5 and 14 years old (54.79%). Among the evaluated risk groups for LTBI, the most frequent were children household contacts with pulmonary TB cases (61-83.65%), followed by people living with HIV (9-12.33%) and only 3 cases with other medical reasons. Positive TST had 34 cases (46.57%) and positive IGRA test 25 cases (34.25%). Regarding the treatment regimes, we use two regimes: 50 cases (68.44%) received 6 months daily regime with Isoniazid, and 23 cases (31.51%) received 3 months daily regime with Isoniazid and Rifampicin. Treatment outcomes showed that the most patients completed treatment regimes: 55 (75.34%) and only 10 (13.09%) interrupted the treatment. \n           \n           \n             CONCLUSION: \n             Despite the progress made in the last few years, several challenges remain to be addressed for better management of LTBI which will contribute to strength TB control in the country.",

    "question": "I am a 27 year old female, soon to be 28 and for the past 10-9 years I have been experiencing gradual loss in my memory. At first I ignored it as did my doctor saying it was due to stress, anxiety, and depression but it has come to a point where my memory loss is severely impacting my ability to learn new things. I have also noticed that my cognitive abilities have steadily declined. I am thinking of going either for a masters (Data and Comp Sci) or a second bachelor's in engineering and this is alarmingly affecting my ability to do things.\n\nI used to have lazer focus and that has declined. I used to be able to read books in one sitting. Now, I would read a sentence in a book and not understand what I just read because I couldn't remember important details. When I read books (fiction and nonfiction) I used to remember the detail such as the names, important scenes etc so I can summarize later what happened in the story but that has become impossible. I also noticed that I am not learning new words which used to be something that I loved doing.\n\nWhen I am having conversations, I find myself asking the same question over and over again now.\n\nI used to remember faces well but that has stopped as well. This one day, I was in a college club and I met this guy. We talked for a little bit and when I ran into him a few days later again in college, I didn't recognize him at all until he said that we met and talked at the college club.\n\nSomething that has really alarmed me is muscle memory loss. When I do something over and over, say cutting a vegetable, I noticed that I would become faster as I spend more time doing it. And I would do things automatically, like breathing, but that has stopped as well.\n\nI have noticed that when I bend my thumb sometimes, it shakes. Not always, but sometimes.\n\nI also have a hard time distinguishing between faces, something that wasn't an issue for me.\n\nI have a hard time distinguishing between similar things now which wasn't an issue for me before.\n\nI used to be very good at recognizing places. I would remember the places I have been to when I am walking through the place again. That has stopped as well. I don't remember or recognize houses places that I have been past two to three times.\n\nI would remember the things that happened during the day. But now it's more like faint patches and I can't recall details fast and well.\n\nI used to be good at playing board games. Learning new rules to play a new board game is hard now because I forget the rules.\n\nI had really bad sleep hygiene, eating habits in late HS and college and I thought that was the problem. I have been working on eating healthy, having a routine, getting 8 hours of restful sleep. I exercise daily. I was very social and became lonely in HS and college. I have been working on becoming more social as well.\n\nThese things have improved my situation a little but hasn't made a significant impact. It has been two years since I made these changes.\n\nI feel confused a lot.\n\nI have made an appointment with a neurologist. I had an MRI done and the doctor said there was nothing. Bloodwork also came out normal.\n\nI have had low blood pressure and cold hands and feet since I was 14. My doc told me to eat salt when BP is low.

    "document": "Hyperbaric oxygen ameliorates cognitive impairment in patients with Alzheimer's disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment\nAbstract \n           \n             Introduction \n             It has been reported that environmental factors such as hypoxia could contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therapeutics like hyperbaric oxygen treatment, which improves tissue oxygen supply and ameliorates hypoxic conditions in the brain, may be an alternative therapy for AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The present work aims to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of hyperbaric oxygen treatment for AD and aMCI. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We recruited 42 AD, 11 aMCI, and 30 control AD patients in this study. AD and aMCI patients were treated with 40\u00a0minutes of hyperbaric oxygen once a day for 20 days and assessed by neuropsychiatric assessments including Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale before and at 1\u2010, 3\u2010, and 6\u2010month follow\u2010up after treatment. Control AD patients who were not given hyperbaric oxygen treatment had similar clinical profile as hyperbaric oxygen treated AD. We examined 10 of the AD/aMCI patients with fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             In self\u2010comparison study, one course of hyperbaric oxygen treatment significantly improved the cognitive function assessed by MMSE and MoCA in AD patients after 1\u2010month follow\u2010up; such treatment also significantly improved MMSE score at 3\u2010month follow\u2010up and MoCA score at 1\u2010 and 3\u2010month follow\u2010up in aMCI patients. The ADL scale was significantly improved in AD patients after 1\u2010 and 3\u2010month follow\u2010up. Compared to the control AD patients, the MMSE and MoCA in hyperbaric oxygen treated AD patients were significantly improved after 1\u2010month follow\u2010up. Hyperbaric oxygen treatment also ameliorated the reduced brain glucose metabolism in some of the AD and aMCI patients. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Based on previous studies and our recent findings, we propose that hyperbaric oxygen treatment may be a promising alternative therapy for AD and aMCI.",
    "response": "It looks like there is a small amount of data to support hyperbaric oxygen therapy for patients with Alzheimer's dementia, but the geriatric/memory community of physicians are not fully convinced of its efficacy (see links below).  With the proposed physiology of how hyperbaric oxygen helps patients with Alzheimer's, I wouldn't expect it to help with all forms of memory impairment.  I don't think it would help with your problems.  There are many other organic causes and treatable of your memory problems that would be much more likely in someone young like yourself.  These may have atypical presentations like you are describing -- depression, sleep apnea, hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, etc.  Keep working with your primary care doc / GP to sort it out.\n\n[\n\n["

I don\u2019t drink, smoke or use drugs. I\u2019m on is 40 mg nexium and been on that since April but been using PPIs since October 2014.\n\nProblem is that I can\u2019t eat anything without having constant moderate - severe stomach discomfort, tightness, lots of gas, feeling of needing to have a bowel movement. I am also experiencing slight fecal incontinence which is worse after bowel movements.\n\nI can\u2019t eat anything without this happening, I\u2019ve been on many diets without relief. I noticed that the stomach tightness disappears when I have forgotten to take my medication and my stomach just feels better. This is the only thing that makes me feel better, not being on medication. Problem is that if I\u2019m not on any medication, I will have severe reflux no matter what I eat. I explained this to the doctors but they are a bit skeptical and told me that this shouldn\u2019t happen, that nexium shouldn\u2019t do this. Yet not being on medication seems to help. I tried being on H2 blockers but I don\u2019t get relief from the stomach symptoms, I only get relief when I\u2019m not using PPIs / H2 blockers at all.

    "document": "Proton pump inhibitors and dysbiosis: Current knowledge and aspects to be clarified\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are common medications within the practice of gastroenterology. These drugs, which act through the irreversible inhibition of the hydrogen/potassium pump (H+/K+-ATPase pump) in the gastric parietal cells, are used in the treatment of several acid-related disorders. PPIs are generally well tolerated but, through the long-term reduction of gastric acid secretion, can increase the risk of an imbalance in gut microbiota composition ( i.e ., dysbiosis). The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem in which microbes coexist and interact with the human host. Indeed, the resident gut bacteria are needed for multiple vital functions, such as nutrient and drug metabolism, the production of energy, defense against pathogens, the modulation of the immune system and support of the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier. The bacteria are collected in communities that vary in density and composition within each segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Therefore, every change in the gut ecosystem has been connected to an increased susceptibility or exacerbation of various GI disorders. The aim of this review is to summarize the recently available data on PPI-related microbiota alterations in each segment of the GI tract and to analyze the possible involvement of PPIs in the pathogenesis of several specific GI diseases.",

    "document": "An ambulatory dyskinesia monitor\nOBJECTIVES \u2014New\ntreatments are now becoming available for the management of levodopa\ninduced dyskinesias in Parkinsons's disease. However, assessment of\ntheir efficacy is limited by the inadequacies of current methods of\ndyskinesia measurement. The objective was to develop and validate a\nportable device capable of objectively measuring dyskinesias during\nnormal daily activities.\u2028 METHODS \u2014A portable\ndevice was developed based on a triaxial accelerometer, worn on the\nshoulder, and a data recorder that can record levodopa induced\ndyskinesias. A computer program plots raw acceleration and acceleration\nover 0.5 Hz frequency bands against time. The acceleration in the\ndifferent bands can then be compared with the raw acceleration trace,\nenabling identification and exclusion of confounding activities such as\ntremor and walking, which have a characteristic appearance on the\ntrace. The validity of this device was assessed on 12 patients and\neight age matched controls by comparing accelerations in the 1-3 Hz\nfrequency band with established clinical dyskinesia rating scales.\nWhile wearing the monitor, subjects were videorecorded sitting and\nduring dyskinesia provocation tasks, including mental activation tasks,\neating, drinking, writing, putting on a coat, and walking. The\ndyskinesias were graded with both modified abnormal involuntary\nmovement (AIM) and Goetz scales. The clinical ratings were then\ncompared with the mean acceleration scores.\u2028 RESULTS \u2014Acceleration\nin the 1-3 Hz frequency band correlated well against both scales,\nduring all individual tasks. Acceleration produced by normal voluntary\nactivity (with the exception of walking, which produced large\naccelerations, even in controls) was small compared with dyskinetic\nactivity. With walking excluded, the mean acceleration over the rest of\nthe recording time correlated strongly with both the modified AIM\n(Spearman's rank ( r =0.972, p<0.001) and\nGoetz ( r= 0.951, p<0.001) scales.\u2028 CONCLUSIONS \u2014This\nmethod provides an accurate, objective means for dyskinesia assessment,\nand compares favourably with established methods currently used.",

In this manuscript, we use endogenous cell nuclei as pressure\nsensors by introducing a fluorescent protein localized to the nucleus and\nconfocal microscopy to measure the individual nuclear volumes in 3D\nmulti-cellular aggregates. We calibrate this measurement of nuclear volume to\npressure by quantifying the nuclear volume change as a function of osmotic\npressure in isolated 2D culture. Using this technique, we find that in\nmulticellular structures, the nuclear compressive mechanical stresses are on the\norder of MPa, increase with cell number in the cluster, and that the\ndistribution of stresses is homogenous in spherical cell clusters, but highly\nasymmetric in oblong clusters. This approach may facilitate quantitative\nmechanical measurements in complex and extended biological structures both\n in vitro  and  in vivo .",

    "document": "Inflammatory Biochemical Mediators and Their Role in Myofascial Pain and Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: A Literature Review\nChronic inflammatory pain conditions, specifically myofascial pain\u00a0(MFP), account for an overwhelming percentage of office visits every day. The combination of the high cost of its treatment and frequent patient visits makes MFP a critical pathology to be investigated. Sharpening our understanding of the molecular mechanisms within MFP will expedite the enhancement\u00a0of therapeutic approaches. Inflammation plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of MFP. The chief inflammatory mediators of interest in this review related to MFP are interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1\u00a0(TNF-\u03b1). This review aimed to determine the impact of inflammatory mediators\u00a0on fibroblasts and satellite cells, specifically their role in muscle injury and regeneration. Blocking pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in these cell types could prove to be an effective treatment for MFP. An osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) modality, specifically indirect counterstrain therapy, was investigated in the hopes of elucidating a reduction in particular cytokines. In addition, myofascial release (MFR) therapies (OMT modality) were explored as a potentially effective treatment through the acceleration of wound healing, stimulation of muscle regeneration, and decreased inflammation via altered fibroblast activity. Pharmacologic agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat MFP but have a higher adverse side effect profile compared to OMT therapy. The optimal management of MFP is likely multifactorial, and more treatment modalities must be explored. \n           This literature review analyzed 17 peer-reviewed articles\u00a0specifically related to MFP management and the role of inflammation in MFP. Chronic inflammation from other etiologies was excluded. Our aim was\u00a0to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying MFP and inflammation in an effort to promote the medical community's understanding of treatment modalities for this chronic condition.\u00a0This study revealed that various OMT techniques such as MFR and counterstrain lead to changes on the cellular level in MFP.\u00a0Discovering similar effects on biochemical inflammatory markers with non-pharmacologic treatment modalities was an exciting revelation and one that could potentially change the way physicians address pain management.",

    "document": "Health-related quality of life outcomes after cholecystectomy\nGallbladder diseases are very common in developed countries. Complicated gallstone disease represents the most frequent of biliary disorders for which surgery is regularly advocated. As regards, cholecystectomy represents a common abdominal surgical intervention; it can be performed as either an elective intervention or emergency surgery, in the case of gangrene, perforation, peritonitis or sepsis. Nowadays, the laparoscopic approach is preferred over open laparotomy. Globally, numerous cholecystectomies are performed daily; however, little evidence exists regarding assessment of post-surgical quality of life (QOL) following these interventions. To assess post-cholecystectomy QOL, in fact, documentation of high quality care has been subject to extended discussions, and the use of patient-reported outcome satisfaction for quality improvement has been advocated for several years. However, there has been little research published regarding QOL outcomes following cholecystectomy; in addition, much of the current literature lacks systematic data on patient-centered outcomes. Then, although several tools have been used to measure QOL after cholecystectomy, difficulty remains in selecting meaningful parameters in order to obtain reproducible data to reflect postoperative QOL. The aim of this study was to review the impact of surgery for gallbladder diseases on QOL. This review includes Medline searches of current literature on QOL following cholecystectomy. Most studies demonstrated that symptomatic patients profited more from surgery than patients receiving an elective intervention. Thus, the gain in QOL depends on the general conditions before surgery, and patients without symptoms profit less or may even have a reduction in QOL.",

    "document": "Placebos without Deception: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Irritable Bowel Syndrome\nBackground \n             Placebo treatment can significantly influence subjective symptoms. However, it is widely believed that response to placebo requires concealment or deception. We tested whether open-label placebo (non-deceptive and non-concealed administration) is superior to a no-treatment control with matched patient-provider interactions in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Two-group, randomized, controlled three week trial (August 2009-April 2010) conducted at a single academic center, involving 80 primarily female (70%) patients, mean age 47\u00b118 with IBS diagnosed by Rome III criteria and with a score \u2265150 on the IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS). Patients were randomized to either open-label placebo pills presented as \u201cplacebo pills made of an inert substance, like sugar pills, that have been shown in clinical studies to produce significant improvement in IBS symptoms through mind-body self-healing processes\u201d or no-treatment controls with the same quality of interaction with providers. The primary outcome was IBS Global Improvement Scale (IBS-GIS). Secondary measures were IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS), IBS Adequate Relief (IBS-AR) and IBS Quality of Life (IBS-QoL). \n           \n           \n             Findings \n             Open-label placebo produced significantly higher mean (\u00b1SD) global improvement scores (IBS-GIS) at both 11-day midpoint (5.2\u00b11.0 vs. 4.0\u00b11.1,  p <.001) and at 21-day endpoint (5.0\u00b11.5 vs. 3.9\u00b11.3,  p \u200a=\u200a.002). Significant results were also observed at both time points for reduced symptom severity (IBS-SSS,  p \u200a=\u200a.008 and  p \u200a=\u200a.03) and adequate relief (IBS-AR,  p \u200a=\u200a.02 and  p \u200a=\u200a.03); and a trend favoring open-label placebo was observed for quality of life (IBS-QoL) at the 21-day endpoint ( p \u200a=\u200a.08). \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Placebos administered without deception may be an effective treatment for IBS.

    "document": "Frequency of horizontal gene transfer of a large catabolic plasmid (pJP4) in soil.\nLimited work has been done to assess the bioremediation potential of transfer of plasmid-borne degradative genes from introduced to indigenous organisms in the environment. Here we demonstrate the transfer by conjugation of the catabolic plasmid pJP4, using a model system with donor and recipient organisms. The donor organism was Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134 and the recipient organism was Variovorax paradoxus isolated from a toxic waste site. Plasmid pJP4 contains genes for mercury resistance and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic (2,4-D) acid degradation. A transfer frequency of approximately 1/10(3) donor and recipient cells (parent cells) was observed on solid agar media, decreasing to 1/10(5) parent cells in sterile soil and finally 1/10(6) parent cells in 2,4-D-amended, nonsterile soil. Presumptive transconjugants were confirmed to be resistant to Hg, to be capable of degrading 2,4-D, and to contain a plasmid of size comparable to that of pJP4. In addition, we confirmed the transfer through PCR amplifications of the tfdB gene. Although transfer of pJP4 did occur at a high frequency in pure culture, the rate was significantly decreased by the introduction of abiotic (sterile soil) and biotic (nonsterile soil) stresses. An evaluation of the data from this model system implies that the reliance on plasmid transfer from a donor organism as a remediative strategy has limited potential.",

We report updated meta-analyses of the trials of 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We undertook a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from 20 trials (n=21\u2008457) in early breast cancer of about 5 years of tamoxifen versus no adjuvant tamoxifen, with about 80% compliance. Recurrence and death rate ratios (RRs) were from log-rank analyses by allocated treatment. \n           \n           \n             Findings \n             In oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease (n=10\u2008645), allocation to about 5 years of tamoxifen substantially reduced recurrence rates throughout the first 10 years (RR 0\u00b753 [SE 0\u00b703] during years 0\u20134 and RR 0\u00b768 [0\u00b706] during years 5\u20139 [both 2p<0\u00b700001]; but RR 0\u00b797 [0\u00b710] during years 10\u201314, suggesting no further gain or loss after year 10). Even in marginally ER-positive disease (10\u201319 fmol/mg cytosol protein) the recurrence reduction was substantial (RR 0\u00b767 [0\u00b708]). In ER-positive disease, the RR was approximately independent of progesterone receptor status (or level), age, nodal status, or use of chemotherapy. Breast cancer mortality was reduced by about a third throughout the first 15 years (RR 0\u00b771 [0\u00b705] during years 0\u20134, 0\u00b766 [0\u00b705] during years 5\u20139, and 0\u00b768 [0\u00b708] during years 10\u201314; p<0\u00b70001 for extra mortality reduction during each separate time period). Overall non-breast-cancer mortality was little affected, despite small absolute increases in thromboembolic and uterine cancer mortality (both only in women older than 55 years), so all-cause mortality was substantially reduced. In ER-negative disease, tamoxifen had little or no effect on breast cancer recurrence or mortality. \n           \n           \n             Interpretation \n             5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen safely reduces 15-year risks of breast cancer recurrence and death.

We also aimed to investigate whether CT findings may be predictive of patients\u2019 outcome. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             From March 6 to March 22, 2020, 130 symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients were enrolled for this single-center analysis and chest CT examinations were retrospectively evaluated. A semi-quantitative CT score was calculated based on the extent of lobar involvement (0:0%; 1, <\u20095%; 2:5\u201325%; 3:26\u201350%; 4:51\u201375%; 5, >\u200975%; range 0\u20135; global score 0\u201325). Data were matched with clinical stages and laboratory findings. Survival curves and univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the role of CT score as a predictor of patients\u2019 outcome. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Ground glass opacities were predominant in early-phase (\u2264\u20097\u00a0days since symptoms\u2019 onset), while crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis characterized late-phase disease (>\u20097\u00a0days). CT score was significantly higher in critical and severe than in mild stage ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001), and among late-phase than early-phase patients ( p \u2009<\u20090.0001).

    "document": "Spectrum of CT appearance and CT severity index of COVID-19 pulmonary infection in correlation with age, sex, and PCR test: an Iraqi experience\nBackground \n             Since June 2020, an explosion in number of new COVID-19 patients has been reported in Iraq with a steady increment in new daily reported cases over the next 3 months. The limited number of PCR kits in the country and the increment in the number of new COVID-19 cases makes the role of CT scan examinations rising and becoming essential in aiding the health institutions in diagnosing and isolating infected patients and those in close contacts. This study will review the spectrum of CT pulmonary changes due to COVID-19 infection and estimate the CT severity score index and its relation to age, sex, and PCR test results . \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The ground glass opacities were the most common encountered pattern of pulmonary changes and were seen in (79%). There was strong positive correlation between higher CT severity score and male gender ( p  value = 0.0002,  R 2  = 0.9). Also, there was significant correlation of CT severity score and increasing age ( p  value less than 0.00018). Significant correlation was seen between CT scan percentage of lung involvement and positive PCR test results ( p  value = 0.001917), as the CT severity index is increasing, the PCR test is more likely to be positive. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Chest CT is an important and fast imaging tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19-infected patients especially in developing countries. In addition, chest CT can predict the disease severity by showing the percentage of lung involvement and hence give an idea about the prognosis of the disease.

I couldn't get in sooner.\n\nSymptoms:\n-Loses balance easily some days, some days she's fine\n-Some days she's completely loopy where it's like she's delirious. She moves very slow and spaces out a lot. Almost like she's intoxicated. She acted this way last time she had a high fever, but she doesn't have a fever.\n-Very tired. She sleeps a lot and never seems well rested when she wakes up. She'll wake up in the morning, go to turn her light on and then stand there, then turn her light back off and go back to bed. Her naps have been much longer than usual.\n-She has issues swinging. She starts to look unwell, sometimes holds her head and asks to get out. I'm assuming she's getting dizziness but I am not certain.\n-She's squinting and sometimes she runs into walls like she can't balance or her depth perception is off. This doesn't happen all the time. Some days she's better.\n-I may have seen involuntary movement with her tongue and sometimes I think she has issues swallowing water. She'll swallow a lot of air which seems weird.\n-She seems to be worse after waking up. Especially the loopiness.\n\nWhat on earth could be going on with my baby? I am so afraid for her and I'm not sure what to do next. This is such a nightmare. Thank you for reading.\n\nEdit: \nI forgot to mention that when she walks fast or runs, she falls over a lot more than what used to be typical for her. She was an early walker.\n\nEdit 2:\nShe was admitted to the hospital when all of these tests were performed and she did see a neurologist. The neurologist is who ordered the EEG and when we went back, the MRI.\n\nEdit 3:\nHere are her test results: \n\nEdit 4:\nMy daughter and I can't thank you enough for taking the time to respond to this post. I wrote this expecting nothing and I am so overwhelmed with appreciation for all of you. If I receive any new information on her condition I will post an update.",
    "document": "Drought stress induces a biphasic NO accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana\nABSTRACT \n           We have recently reported the proteomic signature of the early (\u226430\u00a0min) drought stress responses in  Arabidopsis thaliana  suspension cells challenged with PEG. We found an over-representation in the gene ontology categories \u201cRibosome\u201d and \u201cOxidative stress along with an increased abundance of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) and early response to dehydration (ERD) proteins. Since nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in plant responses to drought stress and induces LEA and DREB proteins, here we monitored the levels of NO in Arabidopsis cell suspensions and leaf disks challenged with PEG, and performed comparative analyses of the proteomics and transcriptomics data in public domain to search for a common set of early drought and NO responsive proteins. \n           We show that under drought-stress, NO shows a biphasic time course, much like in response to ozone stress and that among the early drought and NO responsive proteins, the categories \u201cDNA binding\u201d, \u201cNucleotide binding\u201d and \u201cTranscription regulator activity\u201d are enriched. Taken together, present study suggests that in Arabidopsis the changing NO levels may play a critical role in early drought responsive processes and notably in the transcriptional and translational reprograming observed under drought stress.",

What it sounds like and again there is no way i can know  for certain with out seeing her work up, is vertigo. Most of the causes are benign the ones that aren\u2019t have likely been ruled out with the multiple tests. There are many causes of of vertigo and most will resolve on there own but takes a while. Honesty i dont think anyone can really give you much info over the web continue to follow up with your pediatrician, neurologist and ent they are running the right tests and looking for the right things google will only scare you."

    "question": "I\u2019m a 25 year old female with a bad case of halitosis that I cant seem to get rid of. I\u2019ve done all the obvious things and visited my dentist to try and get help but he doesn\u2019t think the issue is from my mouth. I have very good dental hygiene, floss, brush twice, use mouthwash and a tongue scraper but it\u2019s doesn\u2019t help with the halitosis. The dentist says my teeth and gums are in very good shape and I have no pain whatsoever, in fact I haven\u2019t had any issue with my teeth ever because I\u2019m so religious about dental hygiene. I have a white tongue but scraping it does nothing, and the color varies from thick white to almost pinkish, but the pattern doesn\u2019t change. \n\nHe recommended I go to a doctor to check out if the issue originates from my gut/intestines. I was diagnosed with crohns disease about 3-4 years ago but when I asked my doctor if halitosis is a side effect of it, he said that neither it or the medication I\u2019m on can be the cause. I\u2019ve had halitosis since before my diagnosis and before I started taking any medication. I\u2019m not taking any antibiotics. My doctor did however order an upper endoscopy and I don\u2019t have Gastroesophageal reflux disease but he doesn\u2019t know what else it could be and I\u2019ve gotten no further help. \n\nI have tried everything I could find on the internet, I\u2019m taking probiotics, I\u2019ve tried the candida diet, currently I\u2019m cutting out sugars, caffeine, red meat and all preservative foods. I\u2019ve seen no improvements. \n\nI\u2019m going back to the doctor again next week but I\u2019m hoping I could get some help on here if anyone has seen a similar case and suspects what it could be. This has been a nightmare for me and has had a horrible effect on my social life and I can\u2019t wait to get rid of it.",
    "document": "Halitosis \u2013 An overview: Part-I \u2013 Classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of halitosis\nHalitosis is a condition where the breath is altered in an unpleasant manner for the affected individuals and impairs them socially as well as psychologically. Halitosis can be clinically classified as real halitosis, pseudohalitosis, and halitophobia. Real halitosis has oral and extra-oral etiologies and the pathophysiology involves interaction of anaerobic microbes (mainly) with the proteins present in the oral cavity fluids and contents, resulting in production of volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs). These VSCs, beyond responsible for halitosis, can also initiate and accelerate periodontal disease progression. Thus, this review is about the pathophysiology and various etiologies of halitosis, the knowledge of which can help in the betterment of treatment options.",

It has itched under all my ring fingernails and ring toenails for as long as I can remember. In some of my childhood photos you can catch me scratching them by wedging my thumb nails under my ring nails.\n\n\nI've asked a dermatologist about it before during a consultation for a different issue (pityriasis rosea when I was 11) but they didn't hear me out much and said it's probably my rosea. I don't think it's fungal because my ring fingernails and ring toenails look just like the rest of my nails, except the nails start shorter (I cut them extra short and straight instead of curved). It stings in a good way when I cut them really short, exposing additional skin.\n\n\nIt doesn't disrupt my life that much since it goes away whenever I stop thinking about it, but once I become conscious of it, it will drive me nuts.

    "document": "Neuropathic Itch\nChronic itch can be caused by dysfunctions of itch-sensing neurons that produce sensory hallucinations of pruritogenic stimuli. The cellular and molecular mechanisms are still unknown. All neurological disease categories have been implicated and neurological causes should be considered for patients with otherwise-unexplained itch. The same neurological illnesses that cause neuropathic pain can also or instead cause itch. These include shingles (particularly of the head or neck), small-fiber polyneuropathies, radiculopathies (e.g., notalgia paresthetica and brachioradial pruritis) and diverse lesions of the trigeminal nerve, root, and central tracts. Central nervous system lesions affecting sensory pathways, including strokes, multiple sclerosis, and cavernous hemangiomas can cause central itch. Neuropathic itch is a potent trigger of reflex and volitional scratching although this provides only fleeting relief. Rare patients whose lesion causes sensory loss as well as neuropathic itch can scratch deeply enough to cause painless self-injury. The most common location is on the face (trigeminal trophic syndrome). Treating neuropathic itch is difficult; antihistamines, corticosteroids, and most pain medications are largely ineffective. Current treatment recommendations include local or systemic administration of inhibitors of neuronal excitability (especially local anesthetics) and barriers to reduce scratching.",

As the number of patients recovered from COVID-19 rises and the world transitions toward reopening, the question of acquired immunity versus the possibility of reinfection are critical to anticipating future viral spread. Here, we present a case of a patient previously recovered from COVID-19 who re-presents with new respiratory, radiographical, laboratory, and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) findings concerning for possible re-infection. We review this case in the context of the evolving discussion and theories surrounding dynamic RT-PCR results, prolonged viral shedding, and the possibility of developed immunity.

    "document": "The Natural Course of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease\nNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent form of chronic liver disease in the world, paralleling the epidemic of obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). NAFLD exhibits a histological spectrum, ranging from \u201cbland steatosis\u201d to the more aggressive necro-inflammatory form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which may accumulate fibrosis to result in cirrhosis. Emerging data suggests fibrosis, rather than NASH  per se , to be the most important histological predictor of liver and non-liver related death. Nevertheless, only a small proportion of individuals develop cirrhosis, however the large proportion of the population affected by NAFLD has led to predictions that NAFLD will become a leading cause of end stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and indication for liver transplantation. HCC may arise in non-cirrhotic liver in the setting of NAFLD and is associated with the presence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and male gender. The MetS and its components also play a key role in the histological progression of NAFLD, however other genetic and environmental factors may also influence the natural history. The importance of NAFLD in terms of overall survival extends beyond the liver where cardiovascular disease and malignancy represents additional important causes of death.",

Complications of the infection may affect multiple systems including cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, urinary, and pulmonary systems. Hypokalemia, which is a life-threatening condition that may lead to arrhythmia and possibly death, has been noticed in more than half of the COVID-19 patients.

    "document": "Dystonic Pseudo Foot Drop\nAbstract \n           The most common presentation of foot dystonia in patients with Parkinson's disease ( PD ) or dystonia is inversion of the foot accompanied by flexion of the toes, with or without extension of the hallux. Less commonly, foot dystonia may mimic foot drop, as occurs with weakness of the dorsiflexors muscles, resulting in a pseudo foot drop. This has rarely been reported in the literature and has been poorly recognized, often leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary investigations and treatment. We report 5 patients with dystonic pseudo foot drop, one of them diagnosed with early\u2010onset  PD , 2 with sporadic  PD , and 2 with dystonia. Despite the steppage gait, their physical exam revealed normal strength, and no other explanation for a \u201cfoot drop\u201d was found. It is important to recognize this phenomenology, which can be a clue to the diagnosis of early\u2010onset  PD , and may be responsive to levodopa in selected patients.",

Location: Lower back\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have had lower back and leg pain for most of my life. At 18 I got an xray and the chiropractor said that my lower disks (vertebrae?) were fused together and that I just needed treatment when my leg and back were in pain. Fast forward to 8 years later and I got another xray (wouldn't allow me to attach picture... idk why). My new chiropractor told me that they are in fact NOT fused, and have been degenerating for years. I have never had a back injury so he suggested maybe I was born with very little cushioning between my vertebrae and that it just worsened over the years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, he told me that I will need $4000 worth of treatment and life long weekly adjustments to fix some of the damage and improve my back.

Minor transient adverse events such as increased pain, muscle stiffness, and headache were reported in more than half of patients in the large case series. \n           \n           \n             Meaning \n             Among patients with acute low back pain, spinal manipulative therapy was associated with modest improvements in pain and function and with transient minor musculoskeletal harms. \n           \n        \n           \n             Importance \n             Acute low back pain is common and spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) is a treatment option. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have reported different conclusions about the effectiveness of SMT. \n           \n           \n             Objective \n             To systematically review studies of the effectiveness and harms of SMT for acute (\u22646 weeks) low back pain. \n           \n           \n             Data Sources \n             Search of MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE, and Current Nursing and Allied Health Literature from January 1, 2011, through February 6, 2017, as well as identified systematic reviews and RCTs, for RCTs of adults with low back pain treated in ambulatory settings with SMT compared with sham or alternative treatments, and that measured pain or function outcomes for up to 6 weeks. Observational studies were included to assess harms.  \n           \n           \n             Data Extraction and Synthesis \n             Data extraction was done in duplicate. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Back and Neck (CBN) Risk of Bias tool. This tool has 11 items in the following domains: randomization, concealment, baseline differences, blinding (patient), blinding (care provider [care provider is a specific quality metric used by the CBN Risk of Bias tool]), blinding (outcome), co-interventions, compliance, dropouts, timing, and intention to treat. Prior research has shown the CBN Risk of Bias tool identifies studies at an increased risk of bias using a threshold of 5 or 6 as a summary score. The evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. \n           \n           \n             Main Outcomes and Measures \n             Pain (measured by either the 100-mm visual analog scale, 11-point numeric rating scale, or other numeric pain scale), function (measured by the 24-point Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire or Oswestry Disability Index [range, 0-100]), or any harms measured within 6 weeks. \n           \n           \n             Findings \n             Of 26 eligible RCTs identified, 15 RCTs (1711 patients) provided moderate-quality evidence that SMT has a statistically significant association with improvements in pain (pooled mean improvement in the 100-mm visual analog pain scale, \u22129.95 [95% CI, \u221215.6 to \u22124.3]). Twelve RCTs (1381 patients) produced moderate-quality evidence that SMT has a statistically significant association with improvements in function (pooled mean effect size, \u22120.39 [95% CI, \u22120.71 to \u22120.07]). Heterogeneity was not explained by type of clinician performing SMT, type of manipulation, study quality, or whether SMT was given alone or as part of a package of therapies. No RCT reported any serious adverse event. Minor transient adverse events such as increased pain, muscle stiffness, and headache were reported 50% to 67% of the time in large case series of patients treated with SMT. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions and Relevance \n             Among patients with acute low back pain, spinal manipulative therapy was associated with modest improvements in pain and function at up to 6 weeks, with transient minor musculoskeletal harms.

While the world is working hard to overcome and control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is also crucial to be prepared for the great impacts of this outbreak on the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). It is predicted that inappropriate and too much use of antibiotics, biocides, and disinfectants during this pandemic may raise disastrous effects on antibiotic stewardship programs and AMR control all around the world. Furthermore, the use of certain antibiotics alone or in combination with antiviral agents or other medications for the treatment of secondary bacterial infections among COVID-19 patients may be regarded as a major factor that negatively affects host immune response by disrupting mitochondrial function and activity. Herein, we suggest that the current management strategies to control AMR and prioritize antibiotic stewardship schemes should be extremely highlighted in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rising concerns about excessive use of antimicrobials and biocides and taking too much hygiene also need to be addressed during this pandemic due to their impacts on AMR, public health, and the environment.",

Data regarding concurrent use are sparse. An awareness of data that address this common clinical scenario is important so health care professionals can make informed clinical decisions and address questions in an evidence-based manner. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the evidence behind alcohol warnings issued for many common antimicrobials. The search was conducted from inception of each database to 2018 using PubMed, Medline via Ovid, and Embase. It included studies that involved interactions, effects on efficacy, and toxicity/adverse drug reactions (ADR) due to concomitant alcohol consumption and antimicrobials. All interactions were considered in terms of three components: (i) alteration in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of antimicrobials and/or alcohol, (ii) change in antimicrobial efficacy, and (iii) development of toxicity/ADR. Available data support that oral penicillins, cefdinir, cefpodoxime, fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin, secnidazole, tinidazole, and fluconazole can be safely used with concomitant alcohol consumption. Data are equivocal for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Erythromycin may have reduced efficacy with alcohol consumption, and doxycycline may have reduced efficacy in chronic alcoholism. Alcohol low in tyramine may be consumed with oxazolidinones. The disulfiram-like reaction, though classically associated with metronidazole, occurs with uncertain frequency and with varied severity. Cephalosporins with a methylthiotetrazole (MTT) side chain or a methylthiodioxotriazine (MTDT) ring, ketoconazole, and griseofulvin have an increased risk of a disulfiram-like reaction. Alcohol and antimicrobial interactions are often lacking evidence. This review questions common beliefs due to poor, often conflicting data and identifies important knowledge gaps.",

As beta-lactams are superior to vancomycin in treating methicillin-susceptible  Staphylococcus aureus  (MSSA) bacteremia, we examined the effect of reported penicillin allergy on clinical outcomes in patients with MSSA bacteremia. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             In this retrospective cohort study of adults with MSSA bacteremia admitted to a large tertiary care hospital, outcomes were examined according to reported penicillin allergy. Primary outcomes included 30-day and 90-day mortality rates. Multivariable regression models were developed to quantify the effect of reported penicillin allergy on mortality while adjusting for potential confounders. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             From 2010 to 2015, 318 patients with MSSA bacteremia were identified. Reported penicillin allergy had no significant effect on adjusted 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29\u20131.84;  P  = .51). Patients with reported penicillin allergy were more likely to receive vancomycin (38% vs 11%,  P  < .01), but a large number received cefazolin regardless of reported allergy (29 of 66, 44%). Mortality rates were highest among nonallergic patients receiving vancomycin (22.6% vs 7.4% for those receiving beta-lactams regardless of reported allergy,  P  < .01). In multivariable analysis, beta-lactam receipt was most strongly associated with survival (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12\u20130.54). \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Reported penicillin allergy had no significant effect on 30- or 90-day mortality. Non-penicillin-allergic patients receiving vancomycin for treatment of MSSA bacteremia had the highest mortality rates overall. Receipt of a beta-lactam was the strongest predictor of survival. These results underscore the importance of correct classification of patients with penicillin allergy and appropriate treatment with a beta-lactam when tolerated.",

    "document": "Ovarian Follicular Development During the Use of Oral Contraception: A Review\nOver the past 40 years, alterations to the composition of oral contraceptives (OCs) have been made in attempts to reduce adverse effects and to improve patient compliance while maintaining contraceptive efficacy. However, there is growing evidence to indicate that reducing the estrogen dose to minimize adverse effects may have compromised the degree of hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian suppression, particularly during the hormone-free interval (HFI) or following missed doses. Follicle development during OC use appears to occur in association with a loss of endocrine suppression during the HFI. This information provides a rationale for reducing or eliminating the HFI in OC regimens. There is also evidence for an increased risk of follicle development and ovulation in women who use delayed OC initiation schemes, such as the \u201cSunday Start\u201d method. It is not currently known why some follicles ovulate during OC use while others regress or form anovulatory follicle cysts.

    "document": "Objective evidence that small-fiber polyneuropathy underlies some illnesses currently labeled as fibromyalgia\nFibromyalgia is a common, disabling, syndrome that includes chronic widespread pain plus other diverse symptoms. No specific objective abnormalities have been identified, precluding definitive testing, disease-modifying treatments, and identification of causes. In contrast, small-fiber polyneuropathy (SFPN), despite causing similar symptoms, is definitionally a disease caused by dysfunction and degeneration of peripheral small-fiber neurons. SFPN has established etiologies, some diagnosable and definitively treatable, e.g., diabetes. To evaluate the hypothesis that some patients labeled with \u201cfibromyalgia\u201d have unrecognized SFPN causing their illness symptoms, we analyzed SFPN-associated symptoms, signs, and pathological and physiological markers in 27 fibromyalgia patients and 30 matched normal controls. Fibromyalgia subjects had to satisfy American College of Rheumatology criteria plus present documented evidence of a physician\u2019s actual fibromyalgia diagnosis. Study instruments comprised the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI), the Utah Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS), distal-leg neurodiagnostic skin biopsies, plus autonomic-function testing (AFT). 41% of skin biopsies from fibromyalgia subjects vs. 3% of biopsies from control subjects were diagnostic for SFPN, and MNSI and UENS scores were higher among fibromyalgia than control subjects (all  P  \u2264 0.001). Abnormal AFTs were equally prevalent suggesting that fibromyalgia-associated SFPN is primarily somatic. Blood tests from all 13 fibromyalgia subjects with SFPN-diagnostic skin biopsies provided insights into etiologies. All glucose tolerance tests were normal, but eight subjects had dysimmune markers, 2 had hepatitis C serologies, and one family had apparent genetic causality. These findings suggest that some patients with chronic pain labeled as \u201cfibromyalgia\u201d have unrecognized small-fiber polyneuropathy, a distinct disease that can be objectively tested for and sometimes definitively treated.",

    "document": "A Mathematical Model of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in the United States and its Impact on Cervical Cancer\nBackground:  Mathematical models can be useful tools in exploring disease trends and health consequences of interventions in a population over time. Most cancers, in particular cervical cancer, have long incubation periods. The time from acquisition of HPV infection to development of invasive cancer can be up to two decades or more. Mathematical models can be used to translate short-term findings from prevention and mitigations trials into predictions of long-term health outcomes. The main objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model of HPV for African American women (AAW) in the United States and give quantitative insight into current U.S. prevention and mitigations against cervical cancer. \n           Methods:  A compartmental mathematical model of the cycle of HPV that includes the choices individuals make once they become infected; treatment versus no treatment, was developed. Using this mathematical model we evaluated the impact of human papillomavirus (HPV) on a given population and determined what could decrease the rate at which AAW become infected. All state equations in the model were approximated using the Runge-Kutta 4 th  order numerical approximation method using MatLab software. \n           Results : In this paper we found that the basic reproductive number  R OU  is directly proportional to the rate of infectivity of HPV and the contact rate in which a human infects another human with HPV. The  R OU  was indirectly proportional to the recovery rate plus the mortality by natural causes and the disease. The second  R OT  is also directly proportional to the rate of infectivity of HPV and contact rate in which humans infect another human with HPV and indirectly proportional to the recovery rate plus the mortality from HPV related cause and natural causes. Based on the data of AAW for the parameters; we found that  R OU  and  R OT were 0.519798 and 0.070249 respectively. As both of these basic reproductive numbers are less than one, infection cannot therefore get started in a fully susceptible population, however, if mitigation is to be implemented effectively it should focus on the HPV untreated population as  R OT is greater than 0.5. \n           Conclusion : Mathematical models, from individual and population perspectives, will help decision makers to evaluate different prevention and mitigation measures of HPV and deploy synergistically to improve cancer outcomes. Integrating the best-available epidemiologic data, computer-based mathematical models used in a decision-analytic framework can identify those factors most likely to influence outcomes and can help in formulating decisions that need to be made amidst considerable lack of data and uncertainty. Specifically, the model provides a tool that can accommodate new information, and can be modified as needed, to iteratively assess the expected benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of different policies in the United States. This model can help show the direct relationship between HPV and cervical cancer. If any of the rates change it will greatly impact the graphs. These graphs can be used to discover new methods of treatment that will decrease the rate of infectivity of HPV and Cervical cancer with time.",

    "document": "Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of L1-VLP-Based Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Efficacy against Anogenital Pre-Cancer in Women with Evidence of Prior HPV Exposure\nBackground \n             It is unclear whether L1-VLP-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are efficacious in reducing the likelihood of anogenital pre-cancer in women with evidence of prior vaccine-type HPV exposure. This study aims to determine whether the combined results of the vaccine trials published to date provide evidence of efficacy compared with control (hepatitis A vaccine/placebo). \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and references of identified studies. The bivalent vaccine containing HPV-16 and 18 VLPs from GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Rixenstart, Belgium), the quadrivalent vaccine containing HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18 VLPs from Merck & Co., Inc., (Whitehouse Station, NJ USA), and the HPV-16 monovalent vaccine from Merck Research Laboratories (West Point, PA USA) were evaluated. \n           \n           \n             Findings \n             Three RCT reports and two post-trial cohort studies were eligible, comprising data from 13,482 women who were included in the vaccine studies but had evidence of HPV infection at study entry. Data on efficacy was synthesized using the Mantel-Haenszel weighted fixed-effect approach, or where there was heterogeneity between studies, the DerSimonian and Laird weighted random-effect approach. The mean odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between  Cervarix ,  Gardasil  and HPV-16 monovalent vaccine and HPV-associated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse was 0\u00b790 (95% CI: 0\u00b756, 1\u00b744). For the association between  Gardasil  and HPV-associated vulval/vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2\u20133, the overall OR and 95% CI was 2.25 (95% CI: 0\u00b778, 6.50). Sample size and follow-up were limited. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             There was no evidence that HPV vaccines are effective in preventing vaccine-type HPV associated pre-cancer in women with evidence of prior HPV exposure. Small effects of vaccination however cannot be excluded and a longer-term benefit in preventing re-infection remains possible.",

    "question": "This is going to be long, so thank you in advance for your patience. If there is a more suitable subreddit for me to post this in, please let me know.\n\nI am a 59 year old female. Currently 5\u20198\u201d , 168 lbs. I never got my period as a young girl, and the combination of my mother being really Catholic and not prone to seeing doctors unless it was an emergency made my \u201ccondition\u201d not really discussed or worried about, since it was an awkward subject. But I spent my entire adolescence wondering why I didn\u2019t menstruate like the other girls, and feeling very left out and different. I did develop secondary sex characteristics, but I would give myself a IV on the Tanner scale. I also remember getting hot flashes when I was about 12 or 13 and didn\u2019t understand what was happening.\n\nBy the time I was a senior in college, I had my first serious boyfriend and became sexually active. Even though I didn\u2019t get my period, I was afraid I still might somehow get pregnant and went to the campus gynecologist for birth control. He was concerned about the reason for the primary amenorrhea and ordered a karyotype test. He told me how expensive it was and said since I had medical insurance as a college student this was the time to do it.\n\nI remember it was quite a long time afterwards, I was already out of college by the time I heard anything. He called me and told me I would not be able to have children and I should have my ovaries removed because there was a chance they could become malignant. I don\u2019t recall him ever giving me a name for what was wrong with me, or explaining what my karyotype test said. I never got a written test result. The call was somewhat shocking to me, and I know I didn\u2019t really hear everything he said that day. And now almost 40 years later I remember even less.\n\nI went through a lot of my younger life without medical insurance and I never had regular gynecological care. By my mid 30s I began yearly physicals, but my GP at the time didn\u2019t make a big issue about my lack of periods. He said since I had some breast development I had enough estrogen in my system to protect against osteoporosis. Eventually I began to see a gynecologist and she encouraged me to see if I could find the results of that karyotype test, but too much time had passed and the records were destroyed. She ordered a transvaginal ultrasound and it was discovered that I had streak ovaries. I have had DEXA scans that show osteopenia, and I took Evista for 10 years without it having much effect, so I stopped the Evista and just take calcium and vitamin D supplements and do weight bearing exercise now.\n\nI guess what I am seeking is if there is any way I can gather more clues about my condition without doing another karyotype test. At my age I can\u2019t imagine my insurance approving the test, since there is no real purpose for me having it done, except for my own closure. My current GP and gynecologist both seem unconcerned with my condition. As a matter of fact, the PA at the gynecologist\u2019s office regularly still asks me for the date of my last period. I have to explain each time that I don\u2019t even have functioning ovaries. What if I had one of those genetic tests done like 23 and Me...is it possible that they could determine anomalies with my sex chromosomes? I am so sorry this was so long. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.\n\nEdited to add:\nMy physical appearance might be helpful in giving some clues. I am slim hipped and small-breasted; I am shaped more like a toilet paper roll than an hourglass but I look unmistakably female. My ring fingers are both about 1cm longer than my index fingers. (I know that factor has some bearing on difference between the sexes.) I have no unusual characteristics, but my arms are quite long, my fingers are long and my shoulders just a little bit on the broad side. My feet are large also.

Patients were classified based upon karyotype into females with classical monosomy 45,X (group A) and females with other X chromosome abnormalities (mosaic 45,X/46,XX, Xqisochromosomes, Xp or Xq deletion) (group B). Clinical features of the two groups were analyzed. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Of the 52 patients included in the study, 16(30.8%) were diagnosed with classical monosomy 45,X and the rest with other X chromosome abnormalities.

Electron microscopy was utilized to diagnose \u03b4-SPD. An ELISA assay was used to determine serotonin (5HT) concentration in PLs and medical record review was employed to collect patients\u2019 clinical symptoms. \n           The most common bleeding symptom was easy bruising (71%) but frequent nose bleeds, heavy menstrual bleeding, and a family history of bleeding were also commonly reported. Of the patients studied, 81% were diagnosed with \u03b4-SPD. Our investigation of 5HT concentration extracted from PLs revealed significantly lower levels of 5HT in POTS patients when compared to that of control subjects. Our data suggest that patients with POTS have significant comorbidities including bleeding symptoms and/or family bleeding histories, and have diminished PL 5HT levels supporting the hypothesis that POTS is a low 5HT level disorder. While we describe a significant relationship with POTS and \u03b4-SPD, this finding does not constitute an etiology for POTS. \n           Our results establish an additional comorbidity frequently seen in POTS that could explain a number of disparate symptoms often affecting the severity of POTS.",

    "document": "Biological relevance of ZNF224 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and its implication IN NF-kB pathway regulation\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease, whose presentation and clinical course are highly variable. Identification of novel prognostic factors may contribute to improving the CLL classification and providing indications for treatment options. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 plays a key role in cell transformation, through the control of apoptotic and survival pathways. In this study, we evaluated the potential application of ZNF224 as a novel marker of CLL progression and therapy responsiveness. To this aim, we analyzed ZNF224 expression levels in B lymphocytes from CLL patients at different stages of the disease and in patients showing different treatment outcomes. The expression of ZNF224 was significantly increased in disease progression and dramatically decreased in patients in complete remission after chemotherapy. Gene expression correlation analysis performed on datasets of CLL patients revealed that ZNF224 expression was well correlated with that of some prognostic and predictive markers. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis coupled ZNF224 to NF-\u03baB pathway, and experimental data demonstrated that RNA interference of ZNF224 reduced the activity of the NF-\u03baB survival pathway in CLL cells. Consistently with a pro-survival role, ZNF224 knockdown raised spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis and inhibited the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CLL patients. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of ZNF224 in the survival of CLL cells  via  NF-\u03baB pathway modulation, and also suggest ZNF224 as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of CLL disease.",

This study is to evaluate the efficacy of titanium burr hole cover (BHC) for reconstruction of skull defects in these patients. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             A hundred and ninety-six cases of burr hole trephinations for CSDHs between January 2009 and December 2013 were assigned into two groups; Gelfoam packing only (GPO) and reconstruction using titanium BHC group, according to the modalities of burr hole reconstructions. The incidences and depths of scalp depressions and incidences of postoperative complications such as infections or instrument failures were analyzed in both groups. We also conducted telephone surveys to evaluate the cosmetic and functional outcomes from patient's aspect. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Significantly lower incidence ( p <0.0001) and smaller mean depth ( p <0.0001) of scalp depressions were observed in BHC than GPO group.

IF you can tolerate its effects during the day I would go ahead and dose up with it when your cough has gone from \"junky\" and productive to that dry and irritating bronchitis cough. No real need to cough if there isn't anything to cough up. There are other cough-reducing medications available by prescription.\n\nYou COULD use albuterol any time you feel \"tight\" but, I would use it sparingly. That class of medication can also dry you out. Although, a couple of puffs prior to a humidification or steam session may help open up the old air pipes and get that moisture in there deeper.\n\nConsiderations; make sure you are keeping your humidifiers clean as you can. Water breeds stuff that you don't want to inhale. Also, consider cool mist humidification instead of hot steam showers. When you see an -itis you are talking inflammation which responds really well to cold stuff! Maybe trial an air purifiers indoors? Removing dust and other offending particles could help prevent a cold's progression to bronchitis. I would also consider an NSAID like ibuprofen throughout the course of the illness. Keeping that inflammation down from the getgo is a good idea.\n\nDo you have a pulmonologist you can see?\n\nHope any of this rambling mess of a response helps. I know how frustrating this shit is."

The reconstituted complexes contain chemically modified tetrapyrrole pigments in place of the native bacteriochlorophyll a-B800 molecules. The spectral characteristics of the modified pigments vary significantly, such that within the B800 binding sites the B800 Q(y) absorption maximum can be shifted incrementally from 800 to 670 nm. As the spectral overlap between the B800 and B850 Q(y) bands decreases, the rate of energy transfer (as determined by the time-dependent bleaching of the B850 absorption band) also decreases; the measured time constants range from 0.9 ps (bacteriochlorophyll a in the B800 sites, Q(y) absorption maximum at 800 nm) to 8.3 ps (chlorophyll a in the B800 sites, Q(y) absorption maximum at 670 nm). This correlation between energy transfer rate and spectral blue-shift of the B800 absorption band is in qualitative agreement with the trend predicted from F\u00f6rster spectral overlap calculations, although the experimentally determined rates are approximately 5 times faster than those predicted by simulations.

    "document": "Discordant Sexual Identity in Some Genetic Males with Cloacal Exstrophy Assigned to Female Sex at Birth\nBACKGROUND  Cloacal exstrophy is a rare, complex defect of the entire pelvis and its contents that occurs during embryogenesis and is associated with severe phallic inadequacy or phallic absence in genetic males. For about 25 years, neonatal assignment to female sex has been advocated for affected males to overcome the issue of phallic inadequacy, but data on outcome remain sparse. \n           METHODS  We assessed all 16 genetic males in our cloacal-exstrophy clinic at the ages of 5 to 16 years. Fourteen underwent neonatal assignment to female sex socially, legally, and surgically; the parents of the remaining two refused to do so. Detailed questionnaires extensively evaluated the development of sexual role and identity, as defined by the subjects' persistent declarations of their sex. \n           RESULTS  Eight of the 14 subjects assigned to female sex declared themselves male during the course of this study, whereas the 2 raised as males remained male. Subjects could be grouped according to their stated sexual identity. Five subjects were living as females; three were living with unclear sexual identity, although two of the three had declared themselves male; and eight were living as males, six of whom had reassigned themselves to male sex. All 16 subjects had moderate-to-marked interests and attitudes that were considered typical of males. Follow-up ranged from 34 to 98 months. \n           CONCLUSIONS  Routine neonatal assignment of genetic males to female sex because of severe phallic inadequacy can result in unpredictable sexual identification.

    "document": "Alcohol Use and Alcohol-Related Seizures in Patients With Epilepsy\nPurpose:  This study aimed to assess alcohol consumption and the occurrence of alcohol-related seizures in patients with epilepsy within the last 12 months. \n           Methods:  In an epilepsy outpatient clinic, a standardized questionnaire was used to collect data retrospectively from consecutive adult epilepsy patients who had been suffering from the disease for at least 1 year. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors. \n           Results:  A total of 310 patients with epilepsy were included. Of these, 204 subjects (65.8%) consumed alcohol within the last 12 months. Independent predictors for alcohol use were antiepileptic drug monotherapy (OR 1.901) and physicians' advice that a light alcohol intake is harmless (OR 4.102). Seizure worsening related to alcohol consumption was reported by 37 of the 204 patients (18.1%) who had used alcohol. All 37 subjects had consumed large quantities of alcohol prior to the occurrence of alcohol-related seizures regardless of their usual alcohol-drinking behavior. The amount of alcohol intake prior to alcohol-related seizures was at least 7 standard drinks, which is equivalent to 1.4 L of beer or 0.7 L of wine. In 95% of cases, alcohol-related seizures occurred within 12 h after cessation of alcohol intake. Independent predictors for alcohol-related seizures were generalized genetic epilepsy (OR 5.792) and chronic heavier alcohol use (OR 8.955). \n           Conclusions:  Two-thirds of interviewed subjects had consumed alcohol within the last 12 months. This finding may be an underestimate due to patients' self-reporting and recall error. In all cases, the occurrence of alcohol related-seizures was associated with timely consumption of considerably large amounts of alcohol. Thus, a responsible alcohol intake seems to be safe for most patients with epilepsy. However, subjects with epilepsy and especially those with generalized genetic epilepsy should be made aware of an increased risk for seizures related to heavy alcohol consumption. Factors accompanying acute heavy alcohol intake such as altered sleep architecture, impaired adherence to antiepileptic medication, and metabolic disturbances may further facilitate the occurrence of seizures.",

    "document": "Nitric Oxide Induces the Progression of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms through the Matrix Metalloproteinase Inducer EMMPRIN\nNitric Oxide (NO) is involved in the development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). We found that inhibition of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) protects mice in an elastase-induced AAA model, significantly inhibiting the production of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). The extracellular MMP inducer (EMMPRIN; CD147) was increased in human AAA biopsies and in wild-type murine AAA but not in AAA from iNOS null mice. In cells overexpressing ectopic EMMPRIN, MMP-13 secretion was stimulated, whereas silencing of EMMPRIN by RNA interference led to significant inhibition of MMP-13 expression. In addition, elastase infusion of MMP-13 null mouse aortas induced a significant increase of EMMPRIN but reduced aortic dilatation when compared with wild-type mice, suggesting that NO-mediated AAA may be mediated through EMMPRIN induction of MMP-13. These findings were further verified in elastase-infused iNOS null mice, in which daily administration of NO caused a significant aortic dilatation and the expression of EMMPRIN and MMP-13. By contrast, in iNOS wild-type mice, pharmacological inhibition of iNOS by administration of 1400 W induced a reduction of aortic diameter and inhibition of MMP-13 and EMMPRIN expression when compared with control mice. Our results suggest that NO may regulate the development of AAA in part by inducing the expression of EMMPRIN and modulating the activity of MMP-13 in murine and human aneurysms.",

In very skinny people, you can actually see it when they're laying down. It's a very large artery, so it shouldn't be surprising that you can feel it.\n\nIn medical school we were taught to use both hands with fingers pointing towards the belly button, and kinda \"squeeze\" them together until it feels like you've got that artery right between your fingers. As long as you're not hitting both sides of the artery like 3 inches apart, it's not a concern. You can try this on yourself, just keep bringing the index fingers of both hands together until the pulse is the strongest.\n\nIf it really bothers you, ask your doctor on your next visit.

UIEs most often occur on anesthetized patients but have also been reported on conscious patients. Over the last 30\u00a0years, several parties\u2014both within and external to medicine\u2014have increasingly voiced opposition to these exams. Arguments from medical associations, legal scholars, ethicists, nurses, and some physicians have not compelled meaningful institutional change. Opposition is escalating in the form of legislative bans and whistleblower reports. Aspiring to professional and scientific detachment, institutional consent policies make no distinction between intimate exams and exams on any other body part, but patients do not think of their intimate regions in a detached or neutral way and believe intimate exams call for special protections. UIEs are found to contribute to moral erosion and moral distress of medical students and compromise the sacred trust between the medical community and the general public. This paper refutes the main arguments in favor of the status quo, identifies a series of harms related to continuing the current practice, and proposes an explicit consent policy for intimate exams along with specific changes to medical school curriculum and institutional culture. Because patients are the rights-holders of their bodies, consent practices should reflect and uphold patient values which call for explicit consent for intimate exams.",

My doctor has told me he thinks it's something called laryngospasm, but this doesn't seem exclusively correct, as from my understanding, this is caused by your vocal chords... and that doesn't quite make sense to me.\n\nEdit: I should mention that once I am able to breathe, I typically uncontrollably cough, and sometimes vomit because of my coughs.",
    "document": "Inhalation of electronic cigarette aerosol induces reflex bronchoconstriction by activation of vagal bronchopulmonary C-fibers\nThe electronic cigarette (e-cig) has been suggested as a safer alternative to tobacco cigarettes. However, the health effects of e-cigs on the airways have not been fully investigated. Nicotine, the primary chemical constituent of the e-cig aerosol, has been shown to stimulate vagal bronchopulmonary C-fiber sensory nerves, which upon activation can elicit vigorous pulmonary defense reflexes, including airway constriction. In this study, we investigated the bronchomotor response to e-cig inhalation challenge in anesthetized guinea pigs and the mechanisms involved in regulating these responses. Our results showed that delivery of a single puff of e-cig aerosol into the lung triggered immediately a transient bronchoconstriction that sustained for >2 min. The increase in airway resistance was almost completely abolished by a pretreatment with either intravenous injection of atropine or inhalation of aerosolized lidocaine, suggesting that the bronchoconstriction was elicited by cholinergic reflex mechanism and stimulation of airway sensory nerves was probably involved. Indeed, electrophysiological recording further confirmed that inhalation of e-cig aerosol exerted a pronounced stimulatory effect on vagal bronchopulmonary C-fibers. These effects on airway resistance and bronchopulmonary C-fiber activity were absent when the e-cig aerosol containing zero nicotine was inhaled, indicating a critical role of nicotine. Furthermore, a pretreatment with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists by inhalation completely prevented the airway constriction evoked by e-cig aerosol inhalation. In conclusion, inhalation of a single puff of e-cig aerosol caused a transient bronchoconstriction that was mediated through cholinergic reflex and triggered by a stimulatory effect of nicotine on vagal bronchopulmonary C-fiber afferents.",

    "document": "Diet mimicking fasting promotes regeneration and reduces autoimmunity and multiple sclerosis symptoms\nSummary \n           Dietary interventions have not been effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here we show that periodic 3 day cycles of a fasting mimicking diet (FMD) are effective in ameliorating demyelination and symptoms in a murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. The FMD reduced clinical severity in all mice, and completely reversed symptoms in 20% of the animals. These improvements were associated with increased corticosterone levels and T reg  cell number, reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, T H 1 and T H 17 cells, and antigen presenting cells (APCs). Moreover, the FMD promoted oligodendrocyte precursor cell regeneration and remyelination in axons in response to both EAE and cuprizone MS models, supporting its effects on both suppression of autoimmunity and remyelination. We also report preliminary data suggesting that a FMD or a chronic ketogenic diet are safe, feasible and potentially effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients (NCT01538355).",

    "document": "The Current Status of the Ketogenic Diet in Psychiatry\nBackground \n             The ketogenic diet (KD) has been used in treatment-resistant epilepsy since the 1920s. It has been researched in a variety of neurological conditions in both animal models and human trials. The aim of this review is to clarify the potential role of KD in psychiatry. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             Narrative review of electronic databases PubMED, PsychINFO, and Scopus. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             The search yielded 15 studies that related the use of KD in mental disorders including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These studies comprised nine animal models, four case studies, and two open-label studies in humans. In anxiety, exogenous ketone supplementation reduced anxiety-related behaviors in a rat model. In depression, KD significantly reduced depression-like behaviors in rat and mice models in two controlled studies. In bipolar disorder, one case study reported a reduction in symptomatology, while a second case study reported no improvement. In schizophrenia, an open-label study in female patients ( n \u2009=\u200910) reported reduced symptoms after 2\u2009weeks of KD, a single case study reported no improvement. In a brief report, 3\u2009weeks of KD in a mouse model normalized pathological behaviors. In ASD, an open-label study in children ( n \u2009=\u200930) reported no significant improvement; one case study reported a pronounced and sustained response to KD. In ASD, in four controlled animal studies, KD significantly reduced ASD-related behaviors in mice and rats. In ADHD, in one controlled trial of KD in dogs with comorbid epilepsy, both conditions significantly improved. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion \n             Despite its long history in neurology, the role of KD in mental disorders is unclear. Half of the published studies are based on animal models of mental disorders with limited generalizability to the analog conditions in humans. The review lists some major limitations including the lack of measuring ketone levels in four studies and the issue of compliance to the rigid diet in humans. Currently, there is insufficient evidence for the use of KD in mental disorders, and it is not a recommended treatment option. Future research should include long-term, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover dietary trials to examine the effect of KD in various mental disorders.",

Or anything else?  Colchicine tends to have a mild negative affect on BMI.  \n\nAdditionally, FMF tends to cause GI inflammation that's poorly understood.  There are a few studies that show a fair amount of chronic GI inflammation, especially in the stomach and duodenum, so we often put FMF patients on acid suppression to try to keep this under control.  More importantly, your risk of Crohn's disease is higher with FMF, so workup for this would be helpful (blood work, stool tests, and potentially upper/lower endoscopy).  Difficulty gaining weight is a common presenting symptom of Crohn's disease.\n\nBut, despite those risks, there's a good chance workup for an inflammatory cause will be negative.  In those situations, there are usually one of two things going on.  First, many people with normal appetites are just thin genetically.  It doesn't mean you're unhealthy, it just means you're on the low end of the normal range.  Second, some people have appetite problems (especially with a history of problems in the migraine spectrum), and benefit from appetite stimulants, but that doesn't seem to be the case for you, since you describe eating plenty of food.  \n\nThere is a serious and problematic negative stigma for young men to be skinny.

A total of 290 inpatients meeting rigorous criteria for borderline personality disorder and 72 axis II comparison subjects completed semistructured interviews and self-report measures during their index admission. Subjects were reassessed prospectively over 10 contiguous two-year waves of follow-up. Thirty-nine percent of borderline patients and 73% of personality-disordered comparison subjects met our operationalized definition of excellent recovery (concurrent remission of borderline or another primary personality disorder, good social and full-time vocational functioning, and absence of an axis I disorder associated decreased social and/or vocational functioning). Five variables formed our multivariate predictive model of excellent recovery for borderline patients: higher IQ, good childhood work history, good adult vocational record, lower trait neuroticism, and higher trait agreeableness.

Somatic mutations within the three  CCM  genes have been identified in CCM lesions from both sporadic and familial patients. We reviewed articles published in PubMed in English prior to March 2015 and provide an update on  CCM  mutations and the screening strategies used to identify them. Further, we summarize the specific clinical features related to  CCM  genotypes. As 5 to 15% of familial CCM cases remain genetically unexplained, we also discuss future approaches to expand understanding of the genetic architecture of CCM. Finally, we discuss possible genetic modifiers of CCM disease severity and progression. Understanding the genetic architecture of CCM is essential for an earlier diagnosis of the disease, predictive testing of at-risk patients, and design of targeted medical therapies of which there are currently none available.",

Each result is shown per country. \n           \n           \n             Results. \n             In Latin America, clear founder effects have been reported in Mexico ( BRCA1  del exons 9\u201312), Brazil ( BRCA1  5382insC and  BRCA2  c.156_157insAlu), and Colombia ( BRCA1  3450del4, A1708E, and  BRCA2  3034del4) and in Latinas residing in Southern California ( BRCA1  185delAG, IVS5+1G>A, S955x, and R1443x). Of these, mutation  BRCA1  3450del4 has also been reported in Brazil and Chile, whereas mutation  BRCA2  3034del4 has been reported in Argentina and Peru. These data support the idea that although most Hispanic populations are the result of a mixture between Europeans, Africans, and Amerindians, the relative proportion of each genetic component varies throughout the Hispanic populations, making it necessary to identify the mutations characteristic of each population to generate mutation profiles adjusted to each one of them. \n           \n           \n             Conclusion. \n             In Latin American countries, and even among regions of the same country, there is great heterogeneity of ancestors. Therefore, Latinas should not be analyzed like other population groups without taking into account their genetic ancestry. The presence of founder mutations in specific population groups represents a cost-effective analysis. The importance of determining the founder mutations lies mainly in the decrease in costs. If we manage to decrease costs, screenings could be offered more widely and cover a larger number of women. \n           \n           \n             Implications for Practice: \n             Hispanic and African-American populations are four to five times less likely than other populations worldwide to receive screening for  BRCA  mutations, a main reason being the high costs of these tools. The present study seeks to identify the prevalent mutations and the founder effect in the  BRCA  gene in the Hispanic population to address specific panels for this population group in the future and develop strategies for population screening.",

    "document": "Water Fluoridation: A Critical Review of the Physiological Effects of Ingested Fluoride as a Public Health Intervention\nFluorine is the world's 13th most abundant element and constitutes 0.08% of the Earth crust. It has the highest electronegativity of all elements. Fluoride is widely distributed in the environment, occurring in the air, soils, rocks, and water. Although fluoride is used industrially in a fluorine compound, the manufacture of ceramics, pesticides, aerosol propellants, refrigerants, glassware, and Teflon cookware, it is a generally unwanted byproduct of aluminium, fertilizer, and iron ore manufacture. The medicinal use of fluorides for the prevention of dental caries began in January 1945 when community water supplies in Grand Rapids, United States, were fluoridated to a level of 1\u2009ppm as a dental caries prevention measure. However, water fluoridation remains a controversial public health measure. This paper reviews the human health effects of fluoride. The authors conclude that available evidence suggests that fluoride has a potential to cause major adverse human health problems, while having only a modest dental caries prevention effect. As part of efforts to reduce hazardous fluoride ingestion, the practice of artificial water fluoridation should be reconsidered globally, while industrial safety measures need to be tightened in order to reduce unethical discharge of fluoride compounds into the environment. Public health approaches for global dental caries reduction that do not involve systemic ingestion of fluoride are urgently needed.",

    "document": "Iron deficiency anemia in celiac disease\nIron is an important micronutrient that may be depleted in celiac disease. Iron deficiency and anemia may complicate well-established celiac disease, but may also be the presenting clinical feature in the absence of diarrhea or weight loss. If iron deficiency anemia occurs, it should be thoroughly evaluated, even if celiac disease has been defined since other superimposed causes of iron deficiency anemia may be present. Most often, impaired duodenal mucosal uptake of iron is evident since surface absorptive area in the duodenum is reduced, in large part, because celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder largely focused in the proximal small intestinal mucosa. Some studies have also suggested that blood loss may occur in celiac disease, sometimes from superimposed small intestinal disorders, including ulceration or neoplastic diseases, particularly lymphoma. In addition, other associated gastric or colonic disorders may be responsible for blood loss. Rarely, an immune-mediated hemolytic disorder with increased urine iron loss may occur that may respond to a gluten-free diet. Reduced expression of different regulatory proteins critical in iron uptake has also been defined in the presence and absence of anemia. Finally, other rare causes of microcytic anemia may occur in celiac disease, including a sideroblastic form of anemia reported to have responded to a gluten-free diet.",

    "document": "Outcomes in Hispanics With COVID\u201019 Are Similar to Those of Caucasian Patients in Suburban New York\nAbstract \n           \n             Background \n             Despite reported higher rates and worse outcomes due to COVID\u201019 in certain racial and ethnic groups, much remains unknown. We explored the association between Hispanic ethnicity and outcomes in COVID\u201019 patients in Long Island, New York. \n           \n           \n             Methods \n             We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2,039 Hispanic and non\u2010Hispanic Caucasian patients testing positive for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 between March 7 and May 23, 2020, at a large suburban academic tertiary care hospital near New York City. We explored the association of ethnicity with need for intensive care unit (ICU), invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. \n           \n           \n             Results \n             Of all patients, 1,079 (53%) were non\u2010Hispanic Caucasians and 960 (47%) were Hispanic. Hispanic patients presented in higher numbers than expected for our catchment area. Compared with Caucasians, Hispanics were younger (45 years vs. 59 years), had fewer comorbidities (66% with no comorbidities vs. 40%), were less likely to have commercial insurance (35% vs. 59%), or were less likely to come from a nursing home (2% vs. 10%). In univariate comparisons, Hispanics were less likely to be admitted (37% vs. 59%) or to die (3% vs. 10%). Age, shortness of breath, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), hypoxemia, and presentation from nursing homes were associated with admission. Male sex and hypoxemia were associated with ICU admission. Male sex, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hypoxemia were associated with IMV. Male sex, CHF, CAD, and hypoxemia were associated with mortality. After other factors were adjusted for, Hispanics were less likely to be admitted (odds ratio\u00a0= 0.62, 95% confidence interval\u00a0= 0.52 to 0.92) but Hispanic ethnicity was not associated with ICU admission, IMV, or mortality. \n           \n           \n             Conclusions \n             Hispanics presented at higher rates than average for our population but outcomes among Hispanic patients with COVID\u201019 were similar to those of Caucasian patients.",

    "document": "Mortality Rate and Characteristics of Deaths Following COVID-19 Vaccination\nBackground:  The emergency use authorization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines brought both hopes and concerns to the Americans and others. We aimed to estimate the mortality rate of COVID-19 vaccination and presented characteristics of deaths following COVID-19 vaccination. \n           Methods:  Data on deaths following COVID-19 vaccination were obtained from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) from December 11, 2020 through January 8, 2021. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID Data Tracker was used to identify the total number of people receiving COVID-19 vaccines during the same period to estimate the mortality rate. Stratified analysis was conducted by the location of vaccination. \n           Results:  As of January 8, 2021, 55 deaths were reported, and the mortality rate of COVID-19 vaccination was 8.2 per million population. A total of 37 deaths were reported among long-term care facility residents, and the mortality rate was 53.4 per million population. Top reported comorbidities associated with deaths included hypertension, dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, and heart failure. In addition, dementia was more likely to be associated with deaths vaccinated at long-term care facilities than at other locations. \n           Conclusion:  The benefits of COVID-19 vaccines outweigh the potential risks in older frail populations, and our findings do not support actions to exclude older adults from being vaccinated. However, continued monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination is still warranted.",

    "document": "Aerosolization of Mycotoxins after Growth of Toxinogenic Fungi on Wallpaper\nABSTRACT \n           Many fungi can develop on building material in indoor environments if the moisture level is high enough. Among species that are frequently observed, some are known to be potent mycotoxin producers. This presence of toxinogenic fungi in indoor environments raises the question of the possible exposure of occupants to these toxic compounds by inhalation after aerosolization. This study investigated mycotoxin production by  Penicillium brevicompactum ,  Aspergillus versicolor , and  Stachybotrys chartarum  during their growth on wallpaper and the possible subsequent aerosolization of produced mycotoxins from contaminated substrates. We demonstrated that mycophenolic acid, sterigmatocystin, and macrocyclic trichothecenes (sum of 4 major compounds) could be produced at levels of 1.8, 112.1, and 27.8 mg/m 2 , respectively, on wallpaper. Moreover, part of the produced toxins could be aerosolized from the substrate. The propensity for aerosolization differed according to the fungal species. Thus, particles were aerosolized from wallpaper contaminated with  P. brevicompactum  when an air velocity of just 0.3 m/s was applied, whereas  S. chartarum  required an air velocity of 5.9 m/s.  A. versicolor  was intermediate, since aerosolization occurred under an air velocity of 2 m/s. Quantification of the toxic content revealed that toxic load was mostly associated with particles of size \u22653 \u03bcm, which may correspond to spores. However, some macrocyclic trichothecenes (especially satratoxin H and verrucarin J) can also be found on smaller particles that can deeply penetrate the respiratory tract upon inhalation. These elements are important for risk assessment related to moldy environments. \n           IMPORTANCE  The possible colonization of building material by toxinogenic fungi in cases of moistening raises the question of the subsequent exposure of occupants to aerosolized mycotoxins. In this study, we demonstrated that three different toxinogenic species produce mycotoxins during their development on wallpaper. These toxins can subsequently be aerosolized, at least partly, from moldy material. This transfer to air requires air velocities that can be encountered under real-life conditions in buildings. Most of the aerosolized toxic load is found in particles whose size corresponds to spores or mycelium fragments. However, some toxins were also found on particles smaller than spores that are easily respirable and can deeply penetrate the human respiratory tract. All of these data are important for risk assessment related to fungal contamination of indoor environments.",

    "document": "Starch-Binding Domain Affects Catalysis in Two Lactobacillus \u03b1-Amylases\nA new starch-binding domain (SBD) was recently described in \u03b1-amylases from three lactobacilli ( Lactobacillus amylovorus ,  Lactobacillus plantarum , and  Lactobacillus manihotivorans ). Usually, the SBD is formed by 100 amino acids, but the SBD sequences of the mentioned lactobacillus \u03b1-amylases consist of almost 500 amino acids that are organized in tandem repeats. The three lactobacillus amylase genes share more than 98% sequence identity. In spite of this identity, the SBD structures seem to be quite different. To investigate whether the observed differences in the SBDs have an effect on the hydrolytic capability of the enzymes, a kinetic study of  L. amylovorus  and  L. plantarum  amylases was developed, with both enzymes acting on several starch sources in granular and gelatinized forms. Results showed that the amylolytic capacities of these enzymes are quite different; the  L. amylovorus  \u03b1-amylase is, on average, 10 times more efficient than the  L. plantarum  enzyme in hydrolyzing all the tested polymeric starches, with only a minor difference in the adsorption capacities.",

This neglected disease occurs in scattered foci around the world, with a higher concentration of cases in West Africa. The mycobacteria produce mycolactones that cause tissue necrosis. The disease presents as a painless skin nodule that ulcerates as necrosis expands. Finding acid-fast bacilli in smears or histopathology, culturing the mycobacteria, and performing  M. ulcerans  PCR in presumptive cases confirm the diagnosis. Medical treatment with oral rifampin and intramuscular streptomycin or oral treatment with rifampin plus clarithromycin for 8 weeks is supported by the World Health Organization. This review summarizes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic tests, and advances in treatment.",

    "document": "Bench-to-bedside review: Bacterial pneumonia with influenza - pathogenesis and clinical implications\nSeasonal and pandemic influenza are frequently complicated by bacterial infections, causing additional hospitalization and mortality. Secondary bacterial respiratory infection can be subdivided into combined viral/bacterial pneumonia and post-influenza pneumonia, which differ in their pathogenesis. During combined viral/bacterial infection, the virus, the bacterium and the host interact with each other. Post-influenza pneumonia may, at least in part, be due to resolution of inflammation caused by the primary viral infection. These mechanisms restore tissue homeostasis but greatly impair the host response against unrelated bacterial pathogens. In this review we summarize the underlying mechanisms leading to combined viral/bacterial infection or post-influenza pneumonia and highlight important considerations for effective treatment of bacterial pneumonia during and shortly after influenza.",

Recently I have been thinking about it and how it just feels like a vitamin to me and truly I don\u2019t know if it is truly doing anything. \n\nI first started taking it after a suicide attempt. After the attempt I got a whole new appreciation for everything around me and before I even started the medication I felt more positive but I knew that may not last forever with my past history of self harm and depression. \n\nI understand that anti depressants are difficult to truly see if they work and my family said they saw a difference in me after the first couple months. Still I truly am unsure if it is the pill, the progress I made with my therapist, or both. \n\nMostly likely it is both but then how do I know when I should start to go off taking the Prozac. I think that I\u2019ve been doing better and one less pill is a good thing to do, but it is a difficult idea to process especially since I don\u2019t know how much it is really helping me. I would have no clue how much it does for me until I stop taking it. \n\nI have a therapist and psychiatrist but honestly the psychiatrist meets with me for two seconds ever couple months and with covid-19 I have no clue when I will see her again considering it has been maybe 5 months since I spoke with her for that 5 minute session. I could talk to my therapist about it but I am still unsure if the decision myself. Who knows what will come up in the future or how weaning me off of it will go. I know Prozac is the safest drug for anti depressants and it probably won\u2019t be awful but still I remember how dizzy it made me for the whole first month I started. \n\nI guess my final questions are:\n1.) what are the best ways to know if I should stay on Prozac\n2.)what would the weaning process look like and feel like\n3.)how do I actually know if the Prozac helped at all\n4.) in what way would I go about this if I wanted to go off this pill and what circumstances should I do it around.
